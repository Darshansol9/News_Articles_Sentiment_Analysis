In Progress.

Basic Idea:
Scrap the news articles from various outlets over the internet that are legit and popular.
Preprocess that articles and make it ready for sentiment analysis whether the content is negative , postive news to the society.
Train the DeepMind Dataset with more than 200k articles open sourced by them.
Test the historical data(since 7-8 years from now)  and newly scraped  data ( since three-years from now) to see the deviation in the pessimist news over the years to comment on the human precpetion of reading such news will that be daunting or not.
