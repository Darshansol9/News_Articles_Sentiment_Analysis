story highlight warm current factor caused chain reaction nasa saysregion enough ice raise global sea level 4 foot scientist sayresearchers melting could take several hundred year could impact centurynew research show major section west antarctica ice sheet completely melt coming century probably raise sea level higher previously predicted revealing another impact world changing climate according study released monday warm ocean current geographic peculiarity helped kick chain reaction amundsen sea area glacier melting faster previously realized pushing past point return nasa glaciologist eric rignot told reporter glacial retreat appears unstoppable said rignot lead author joint nasa university california irvine paper used 40 year satellite data aircraft study nasa say region enough ice raise global sea level 4 foot according rignot conservative estimate indicate complete melting antarctic ice cited study could take several century however melting could impact

such rise could displace ten million people coastal area around world anandakrishnan said estimate largely take account melting ice sheet west antarctica study area completed paper others come number 2100 almost certainly lean closer 3 foot said scientist think unstoppablethe rate area ice melting increased 77 since 1973 several reason researcher said ice sheet unlike much east antarctica attached bed sea level that mean ocean current deliver warm water glacier base grounding line place ice attache bed nasa said heat make grounding line retreat inland leaving le massive ice shelf when ice shelf lose mass hold back inland glacier flowing toward sea glaciers flow faster become thin result thinning conducive grounding line retreat nasa said system becomes chain reaction unstoppable every process retreat feeding next one rignot said hill mountain behind grounding line would slow retreat but bed behind nearly amundsen sea glacier slope downward researcher said rignot said belief climate change depletion earth ozone layer partly blame saying changed wind area cause warm water go toward glacier climate change skeptic many backed huge campaign funded fossil fuel industry seek undermine research finding impact popularly referred global warming they challenge scientific validity climate change well role human produced pollution contributing example opponent policy reduce carbon emission say severe north american winter ended evidence increasing antarctic sea ice defied claim scientist warming planet however rignot anandakrishnan said finding west antarctica ice shelf clash news record level antarctic sea ice they noted sea ice form melt quickly glacier subject longer term change rignot added wind stir subsurface heat toward base antarctic ice shelf also expand sea ice cover firstsuch melting would uncommon necessarily unprecedented anandakrishnan said evidence show west antarctica retained ice sheet last 100 000 year cycle glacial formation retreat said evidence also suggests entire west antarctica ice sheet might melted 500 000 600 000 year ago anandakrishnan said six amundsen sea glacier portion entire west antarctic ice sheet though much west antarctic section grounded sea level amundsen sea area vulnerable part fewer hill behind leading edge shape sea floor help usher warm water base nasa said anandakrishnan said possible melting amundsen sea area could destabilize ice sheet the entire west antarctic ice sheet enough ice raise global sea level 16 foot nasa said
