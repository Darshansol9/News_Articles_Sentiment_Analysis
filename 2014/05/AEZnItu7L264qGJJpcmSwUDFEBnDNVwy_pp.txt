story highlight national transportation safety board investigating lithium ion battery boeing dreamlinersits new recommendation follow battery fire 787s last yearthe safety board say faa need revise current standard batteriesfederal safety investigator cast new concern using lithium ion battery power system commercial aircraft saying put rigorous test produce severe outcome approved use sky national transportation safety board issued recommendation thursday continues investigate lithium ion battery boeing 787 dreamliners two battery aircraft self combusted plane last year federal aviation administration boeing vouched safety dreamliner designed battery system and ntsb said change consistent new recommendation safety board said faa need revise 2008 battery standard aircraft remain effect battery tested condition closely resemble condition plane safety board said undergo abuse test cell intentionally damaged and tested way produce severe outcome tests show whether battery experience thermal runaway uncontrollable increase temperature pressure spread cascade adjacent cell thermal runaway typically result smoke known concern faa approved dreamliner battery but smoke event thought rare engineer designed way vent smoke one witness dreamliner battery incident described heavy smoke small 3 inch flame coming battery case material spewing like molten waxaircraft manufacturer need ensure system protect adverse effect ntsb vitally interested recommendation designed prevent accident save life board wrote letter faa administrator michael huerta dreamliner first large commercial aircraft use permanently installed lithium ion battery main battery auxiliary power unit apu the battery valued small lightweight powerful ntsb say seeking certification battery boeing battery manufacturer yuasa corp kyoto japan estimated smoke event would occur le 10 million flight hour 51 662 hour commercial flight two battery failed one culminating fire first incident maintenance worker entered aft electronics bay japan airline dreamliner parked boston logan airport january 7 2013 found heavy smoke small 3 inch flame coming battery housing lithium ion battery provided electricity plane auxiliary power unit apu while incident still investigation ntsb said short circuit one battery eight cell resulted thermal runaway damage spread adjacent cell nine day later main battery nippon airway dreamliner failed flight japan no fire observed damage confined battery housing type failure expected based testing analysis boeing performed part 787 certification process ntsb wrote 2006 test battery manufacturer drove steel nail one battery eight cell induce internal short circuit see damage would result smoke fire damage battery case damaged cell emitted smoke test showed smoke could effectively handled airplane ventilation system faa boeing said believed time thermal runaway could occur cell battery overcharged so took precaution protect overcharging adopted measure vent smoke boeing considered potential short circuit single cell would generate smoke underestimated effect thermal runaway safety board said concerned repeatability test induce thermal runaway battery said researcher found current test method might reliably produce failure effect severe observed real world failure internal short safety board said hard reproduce but important solve improve safety said safety board spokesman told cnn board could make recommendation issue final report likely later year
