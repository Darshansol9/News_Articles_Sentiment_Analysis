He was sorry for having killed his brother, that he hoped his mother would be looked after financially and that she would receive financial recompense from the father's estate, and he said goodbye to his friends," said Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks said."It was more of a farewell," Seabrooks added.JUST WATCHED Police: Santa Monica shooter built gun Replay More Videos ...

A couple of years ago, he was hospitalized for treatment after allegedly talking about harming someone, according to the official.It's not clear whether the California state government or his family committed him for treatment or whether he committed himself. It's also unclear under what circumstances he was released.Zawahri used firearm components to construct a rifle that is illegal to possess, Seabrooks said Friday.He allegedly fired 100 or fewer rounds during a shooting rampage across Santa Monica, adjacent to Los Angeles, that ended at the Santa Monica College, where police shot him to death, authorities said.He was armed with multiple guns and about 1,300 rounds of ammunition, police said.When asked where or how Zawahri obtained the firearms used in the shootings -- especially after the Justice Department deemed him ineligible to buy weapons -- Santa Monica Police Sgt. Richard Lewis stated: "That is a part of the investigation that we will not disclose."His father and brother died of gunshot wounds, and their bodies were found in the back of the father's Santa Monica house, a police spokesman said. Their bodies were identifiable, "and it's not that they were burned beyond recognition," the chief said.Neighbors said the parents were divorced. The mother has spoken with investigators, but the police chief didn't elaborate further.Zawahri was unemployed and hadn't attended Santa Monica College, where his shooting rampage ended, since 2010, a police spokesman said Friday.Gunman previously hospitalized for mental health
