A bullet grazed the second officer's hand, he said.Both officers were treated and released from a hospital.The shooter is still at large, Smith said.The officers work on an undercover burglary task force, but it is unknown if the attack was related to their assignment."Usually, burglars don't go after the people that are searching for them, so this seems like a more violent suspect," Smith said.Such a brazen attack outside a police station is very unusual, he said.All of the LAPD's 19 police stations increased their security as a precaution, he said.
