Its new director, Sylvester Young, reported for work earlier this month."When considering all of the measures we have put in place, I believe this constitutes us having the right conditions," Robinson said.Champion's parents, Robert Sr. and Pam, said they were not consulted about the decision. Their attorney told CNN Atlanta affiliate WSB that hazing has occurred this year at the university."They are putting dollars over the students," Robert Champion Sr. said of FAMU.Pam Champion said anti-hazing steps taken by FAMU are insufficient."You need a lot more in order to get that message out," she told WSB. "You need to be in those schools, in their face, every opportunity that you can get."Robinson's predecessor as FAMU president, James Ammons, stepped down in July 2012 after trustees issued a no-confidence motion in his performance. The vote followed a series of investigations after Champion's death. The vote also related to financial audits that resulted from the hazing investigation.Twelve former students faced manslaughter charges in the Champion case, attorneys familiar with the case said in March. The band member's roommate in May pleaded nolo contendere, or no contest, to a felony charge of hazing resulting in death and first-degree hazing.
