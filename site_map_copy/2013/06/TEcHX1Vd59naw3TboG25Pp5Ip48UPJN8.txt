He was transported to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead.Acknowledging it appears to have been a tragic accident, Bonney cautioned gun owners"We want to remind people without making a villain of this person, that if a child is visiting your home, the first thing to do would be put the firearm away."No charges were anticipated because the incident was an accident, Bonney told CNN.
