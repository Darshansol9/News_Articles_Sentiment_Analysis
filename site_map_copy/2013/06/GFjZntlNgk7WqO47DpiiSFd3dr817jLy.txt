Psaki said the United States expects the Taliban will raise that issue again when the two sides meet.In the past, U.S. officials have talked about transferring the Guantanamo detainees in two stages -- perhaps two men first, and then after Bergdahl is released, transferring the remaining three.Senior U.S. officials have also discussed the idea of transferring all five Taliban prisoners to Qatar first, before Bergdahl is freed.Under U.S. law, Congress must be consulted before any detainees are transferred from Guantanamo.
