She got on her phone and called 911 while she maneuvered herself into position under the boy.She told CNN's Alina Cho, "I saw the baby, kind of straddling (a) pole ... and I started talking to him, as I'm talking to 911, and saying, 'Please stay up there, please.' ""The minute he let go, I just hoped for the best and had my arms out waiting for him," she said.Torre said the boy was crying and bleeding from the mouth after hitting something on the way down, but otherwise seemed to be all right.The boy's father came down later, thanked Torre for saving his son and gave her a hug.She hugged him back, she said.Torre's dad released a statement Wednesday night saying, "I am very proud of my daughter Cristina's actions today during an incident in Brooklyn involving a small child. Fortunately for that child she was in the right place at the right time to lend a hand."Cristina Torre, in turn, credited her father, who was a major league All-Star catcher in his playing days, with having a role in the rescue, sort of."I do think I got that hand-eye coordination from my dad," she said.
