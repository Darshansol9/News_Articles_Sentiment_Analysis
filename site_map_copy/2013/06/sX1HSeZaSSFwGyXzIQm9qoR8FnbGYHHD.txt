Daryl Dean Jenkins and his wife, Shirley Mae Jenkins, died on April 16; 11-year-old Jeffrey Williams died on June 8.Hall received an e-mailed copy of the toxicology report on Shirley Mae Jenkins' death from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services on June 1, a spokesman for the state agency said.The report showed an often lethal concentration of carbon monoxide in her blood but did not provide a formal cause of death.JUST WATCHED The mysterious deaths in Room 225 Replay More Videos ...

Andy Le Beau told CNN on Tuesday. Investigators also found holes in the ventilation pipes just below the room, he said."The heater itself runs off of natural gas. A byproduct of the pool heater is carbon monoxide. The ventilation system that ventilates the carbon monoxide goes to outside the building, in close proximity to the heating and air conditioning units of 225," Le Beau added. "In addition, there were deficiencies found in the ventilation pipes that were in the ceiling area just below room 225. Carbon monoxide could also get into the room from that method as well."Search warrant documents show police removed two sections of exhaust pipe for the heater from below the room, WSOC said.
