Texas Gov. Rick Perry has renewed a drought emergency in more than 200 counties throughout the state, authorizing "all necessary measures" be implemented to aid response efforts."Prolonged dry conditions continue to increase the threat of wildfire across many portions of the state," the governor's proclamation said this week. "These drought conditions have reached historic levels and continue to pose an imminent threat to public health, property and the economy."Low rainfall and record high temperatures have reduced water supplies and aquifer levels, threatening many parts of the state, the proclamation said.The emergency proclamation suspends "all rules and regulations that may inhibit or prevent prompt response to this threat" for the duration of the state of disaster.Perry initially issued an emergency disaster proclamation on July 5, 2011, and Monday's proclamation extends that emergency.
