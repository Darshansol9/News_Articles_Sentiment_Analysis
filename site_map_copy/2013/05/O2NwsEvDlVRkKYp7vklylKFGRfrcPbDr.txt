I didn't believe it was my mom the first time I saw them," Jones told CNN, choking back tears. "And then I had to look again and I looked at her body and her feet and her hands and her nose and her mouth. And I knew it was her."Jones added that she's upset the pictures have gotten out, saying "I shouldn't have to see my mother's body like that all over the media and the Internet."

"And that she was interested in going over there to help. But she didn't think it would be fighting. She told me there wouldn't be (guns) or anything. She would never be involved in that.""And they lied to her. They misled her and they took her and brought her over there, probably paid for her ticket and everything, and they kept her there."CNN asked Jones if she could be more specific about what she meant by "project.""That it was to help free the Syrians from the Syrian government and all the problems that they're having over there," she answered.Nicole's father, Gregory Mansfield, contacted the FBI when his daughter left the United States three years ago, but he was not clear on where she went.CNN asked Gregory Mansfield why he thought his daughter going abroad was disturbing enough to warrant notifying the FBI. He refused to explain. He said his worries concerned "Israel" and repeatedly insisted to CNN that the FBI should have revoked his daughter's passport.Nicole's grandmother, Carole, said she last saw her granddaughter in Michigan in January. Another relative recently got a call from Nicole Mansfield in which she said she was gone, but she'd be back to the United States for a visit soon.Carole Mansfield and Monica Steelman, Nicole's aunt, described Nicole as caring and outgoing, saying she'd sometime travel without telling her family where she was heading. She had worked as a home care worker and had been married twice, including to a man who practiced Islam."Nicole was the type of person if she thought that something was wrong somewhere, that she could help repair it," said her aunt.Her niece tried to be a "problem solver," she said."Trouble spots," Carole Mansfield said, "... fascinated her."Raised Christian, she converted to Islam three to five years ago and used to worship at a mosque in Flint. Carole Mansfield said she spoke to her granddaughter after her conversion."At that time I told her that I thought she was looking a rattlesnake in the eyes," the grandmother said. "But that's my belief. Not that I felt it made her a bad person."
