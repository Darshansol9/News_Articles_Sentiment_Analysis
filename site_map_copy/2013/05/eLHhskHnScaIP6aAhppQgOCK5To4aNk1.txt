"It shows our resolve. You can blacken our eye, but you're not going to kill us. We're going to come back. So, it's awesome.""I'm still taking it in," said tourist Joyce Elter of Las Vegas. "I mean, it was such a devastation back then, and everything is progressing. It still has a long way to go, but it's phenomenal."The pieces installed Friday morning were hoisted to a temporary platform atop the building last week.The spire contains 18 steel sections and three communication rings. The first -- and heaviest -- steel section was installed in January. It weighs more than 67 tons, according to a statement from the Port Authority.It will be an antenna for a television broadcast facility in the building, which rises from the site near the original World Trade Center towers, which fell in the 2001 attacks.Last week, construction director Steven Plate told CNN affiliate WABC that the spire will be a "beacon that'll be seen for miles around and give a tremendous indication to people around the entire region, and the world, that we're back and we're better than ever."Construction on the building began in April 2006.
