He turned the handgun toward the officer, she said.The officer, fearing for his life, drew his gun and fired, Roach said.Authorities have not identified the officer.At the time of the shooting, Smith was wanted for jumping parole, police said.He was on parole for first-degree robbery and had an "extensive" arrest history that includes robbery, assault, and promoting prison contraband, said police in Nassau County.A warrant for his arrest was issued April 25 for allegedly absconding from parole, police saidRebello's high school principal, Carol Conklin-Spillane, said the twins' home community in Westchester was heartbroken.She described Rebello as a fun-loving, personable and self-aware young woman.Her parents, Fernando and Nella Rebello, are closely tied to the Portuguese community, and always worked to create opportunities for their children, Conklin-Spillane said.Rebello, a junior, was majoring in public relations.At Sunday's graduation ceremony, Rabinowitz recalled a Bob Marley quote that Rebello found inspiring: "Live the life you love and love the life you live."Hofstra University said it is offering counseling to students.A funeral Mass is planned for Wednesday.
