Another federal law enforcement official would only comment: "We want to talk to them."The men "may be able to provide information to help in the investigation," the FBI said in a statement.The FBI released pictures of the three men -- each labeled as "unknown person" -- on its website and asked people to e-mail tips to BenghaziTips@ic.fbi.gov. The photos came from surveillance video taken the night of the attack on a diplomatic facility and CIA annex."This is thoroughly thought out," the federal law enforcement official told CNN, adding the first step is not to just "blast out photos."
