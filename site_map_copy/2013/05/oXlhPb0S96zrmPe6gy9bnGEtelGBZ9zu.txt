Born a male, Autumn Sandeen said as a teen, she identified as a female.She joined the Navy, lived as male and kept her secret for two decades before retiring."If I would have been myself, I would have been kicked out," said Sandeen.According to military guidelines, gender identity issues are a mental disorder and detrimental to good order and discipline.In 2011, as the ban on gays and lesbians was lifted, the transgender ban remained."The best way to explain it is I felt like a bridesmaid, never a bride," said Sandeen.Twenty months later, a step down the aisle toward acceptance."I felt tremendous, like I accomplished something, not just himself, but for the broader transgender community," said Sandeen.It's a process that began in 2011. She appealed to the VA, then the Pentagon. It ended with the Pentagon granting her an official change of gender on all military documents.She submitted a mountain of paperwork, including a revised birth certificate.It's the first documented case of a gender change in the military."They're acknowledging that transgender people exist and not completely off their rockers," Sandeen told 10News.Sandeen said the recognition of a veteran's gender change forces the question: why shouldn't an active service member be able to change as well?One thing suddenly helping her cause: as of mid-May 2013, psychiatric manuals no longer classify gender identity issues as a mental disorder."I feel like we should able to serve openly because we are physically able to serve openly. It's not a disorder," said Sandeen.Sandeen hopes the U.S. will join seven other countries in allowing transgender troops.There is no word from the Pentagon on whether the change in the psychiatric manuals could prompt a change in policy.Click here for a previous story featuring Sandeen.
