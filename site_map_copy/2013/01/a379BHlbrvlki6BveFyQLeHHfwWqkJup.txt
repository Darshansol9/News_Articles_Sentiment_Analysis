The suspect is thought to be between 25 and 30 years old, she said.The attack occurred around 3:30 p.m. Tuesday in Philadelphia's Chinatown, after a man approached a 23-year-old woman and asked her for a lighter. They were the only people at the Eighth and Race streets stop, Redfern said.A surveillance camera captured the assault. It shows the man attacking the woman and pulling her off a bench, her back hitting the floor as he slides her toward the tracks. She manages to stand at the edge of the platform just before he hurls her off."I started trying to fight him back as much as I could," the victim told CNN affiliate KYW . "After it was over, the first thing that popped in my head was my son."She "managed to climb off the tracks, suffering only minor bruises and scrapes," Redfern, said.After the attack, the man, who is thought to be homeless, took the victim's cell phone and left the subway station.Police say they increased manpower in stations but withheld the video of the attack from the public because the attacker was wearing a jacket with a distinctive logo, and police hoped he wouldn't discard the jacket.Clark was taken into custody Thursday afternoon, wearing a jacket with the Taj Mahal logo on the back, Redfern said. Police are seeking a motive but say they believe the attacker could be mentally unstable.
