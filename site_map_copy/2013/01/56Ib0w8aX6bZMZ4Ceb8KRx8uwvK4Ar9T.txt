Columbus (77), and Macon (78), also broke records.The East Coast is enjoying a ridge of high pressure that has provided a dome of warm air, said Atlanta NWS forecaster Keith Stellman.But by Wednesday, the high in Atlanta will be in the 50s, and lows will reach the mid-30s. "Basically we will be back to normal temperatures," Stellman told CNN.Parts of the West were enduring the coldest air of the season thus far.According to CNN affiliate KCAL , freeze warnings were expected to be in effect through 9 a.m. Sunday for most of Southern California, with a freeze watch posted for Sunday night through Monday morning.In Arizona, a freeze warning will remain in effect in Phoenix until Tuesday morning.The Phoenix Rescue Mission reached out to those who were spending the night outdoors by providing blankets and clothing items."As the cold weather takes effect on people and they're out there in the elements, we want to remind them that we bring a team of people who actually care about them," the organization's Clifford Danley told CNN affiliate KTVKArizona citrus growers scrambled to protect their trees.One grower deployed circulating water to produce heat and smudge pots.
