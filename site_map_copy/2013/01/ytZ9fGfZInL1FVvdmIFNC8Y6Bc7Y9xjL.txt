Following his ouster, clan warlords and militants battled for control, sparking a civil war and mayhem nationwide.The nation since then has mostly been under shaky transitional federal governments.But the final transitional federal government made "unmistakable" progress, Clinton said, with Somali security forces supported by an African Union mission and troops from Uganda, Burundi, Kenya and Djibouti driving Al Shabaab from the nation's cities and towns.JUST WATCHED Somali professor: Education is key Replay More Videos ...

"We will be very clear-eyed and realistic about the threat they continue to pose."She said she looks forward to the re-establishment of a permanent U.S. diplomatic presence in Mogadishu.The news conference came shortly after President Barack Obama met with his Somali counterpart at the White House, a meeting that Clinton described as "a very strong signal to the people of Somalia of our continuing support and commitment."Mohamud acknowledged that his country is "emerging from a very long, difficult period" marked by instability, extremism and piracy , and is moving toward an era of peace and development."We are aiming to make a valuable contribution to the region and the world at large," he said.He described the past 22 years as "difficult times" during which "the United States has always been the country that never left Somalia."He credited U.S. intervention in the early 1990s with having saved more than 300,000 Somali lives. "Had that intervention not been there, it would have been difficult and different today -- the situation in Somalia," he said.
