The State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs offers a wide range of academic, cultural, private-sector, professional and sports exchange programs."These visits offer an opportunity to show a different American face to other countries, one that is non-commercial, non-political, and non-military," one State Department official said of the exchanges. "They support personal growth, lead to a deeper understanding of foreign cultures and improve international relationships"After a 25-year hiatus, the International Visitor Leadership Program was restarted with Iran in 2006. Since then, the State Department has hosted 31 groups of Iranian mid-level professionals, mostly in the arts, medicine and sports, in an effort to build relationships with the Iranian people and hopefully create a basis for further cooperation.
