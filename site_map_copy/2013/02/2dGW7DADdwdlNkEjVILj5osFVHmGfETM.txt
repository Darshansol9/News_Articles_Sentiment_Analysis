There are about 190 ACT test sites in the path of the storm, and 103 had canceled by Friday afternoon, ACT spokesman Ed Colby said. Tests were canceled in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont.The test dates will be rescheduled , usually at the same testing site or another one nearby, as soon as possible, Colby said. If students aren't available on the retake date, they'll be able to take the ACT on the next national testing date, April 13Local test officials make the decision on whether to cancel. Test takers can check with their testing sites at ACTstudent.org or by calling 319-337-1270 or 319-337-1510."We will be updating our website continually and getting those cancellations up there as soon as we get them, probably into the night and perhaps into the morning," Colby said.The February testing date is typically a mix of juniors preparing to apply for college, and some seniors who haven't yet made a college choice.It's not unprecedented for ACT tests to be canceled -- a few sites might be affected by smaller winter storms, for example -- but it's rare to have so many cancellations at once. A lucky break: There are no New York test sites in February, Colby said, so that area won't have to scramble for makeup tests dates or sites."That's one saving grace," Colby said.CNN's Devon Sayers contributed to this report.
