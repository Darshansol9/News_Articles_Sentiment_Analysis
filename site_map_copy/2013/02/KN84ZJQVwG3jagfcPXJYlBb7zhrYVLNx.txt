It's important to note that the Secretary did not base his decision on the individual's marital status or state recognized relationship status, but rather based it, in part, on evidence of a committed relationship between the individual and the Veteran," it read.His decision applies just to Campbell and Lynchild; it does not represent an official change in policy.Though gay people can now serve openly, the military doesn't formally recognize same-sex marriage under the federal Defense of Marriage Act.The divisive act, which was passed in 1996, bars federal recognition of same-sex marriages and says other states cannot be forced to recognize them.During her 25-year military career, Campbell served in the National Guard and Reserve. She was an Air Force recruiter, a military aide to the Oregon governor and served on the Governor's Military Advisory Council. During the Vietnam War, her duties included Air Force casualty notification for Colorado.Lynchild worked as a home repair specialist and as director of housing with the Housing and Community Services Agency of Lane County, Oregon, according to a statement from Campbell, Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley and Oregon Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian.The senator applauded the secretary's decision."I can only hope that this historic moment is just the first of many for same-sex couples across the nation. All our veterans deserve the honor of being buried in a national cemetery with their partners by their side," he said.
