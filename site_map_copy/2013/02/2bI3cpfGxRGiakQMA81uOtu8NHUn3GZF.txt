Import USA Corp., ZCY Trading Corp., Zone Import Corp. and ZY Wholesale Inc."They allegedly retooled their operations many times in order to avoid detection and despite repeated citations by the authorities, they continued to peddle counterfeit toys," Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breur said in a statement Wednesday.The defendants allegedly sold toys from a storefront and warehouse in Ridgewood Queens, as well as other spots throughout Brooklyn and Queens, according to court documents.Federal officers seized shipping containers entering the United States from China under these toy company names on 33 separate occasions, according to prosecutors.Seventeen of those seizures yielded toys with excessive lead content and phthalate levels, small parts that presented choking and ingestion hazards, and easily accessible battery compartments, officials said.Each seizure confiscated "hundreds and hundreds" of toys at a time, according to Martinez.Calls to prosecutors were not immediately returned.
