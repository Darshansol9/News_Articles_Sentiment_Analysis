Its peanut paste was sold to customers nationwide and used in crackers, cookies, and other items.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said the company shipped tainted product it knew had tested positive for bacteria linked to the salmonella outbreak.U.S. Attorney Michael Moore of Macon said the accused are expected to appear in court in Albany next week.The defendants were identified as Stewart Parnell, 58, of Lynchburg, Virginia; Michael Parnell, 54, of Midlothian, Virginia; Samuel Lightsey, 48, of Blakely; and Mary Wilkerson, 39, of Edison, Georgia.Three of the four were also charged with obstruction of justice, Justice Department officials said.Authorities said Daniel Kilgore, 44, of Blakely pleaded guilty to similar counts this week.Food recalls are common, but criminal indictments around them are not.Charges in this case appear to have been prompted, in part, by the defendants' alleged knowledge of the salmonella-tainted product shipment and an alleged cover-up.Those charged could face stiff jail terms, if convicted.
