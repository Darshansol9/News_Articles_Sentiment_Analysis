Three of the company's workers were hospitalized, Hack said.'I thought I was going to die'The odor of natural gas led to the early closure of JJ's restaurant, but hostess Deidre Estes and other employees weren't in a rush to leave, unaware of the danger they were in.The blast ripped the roof off of the restaurant."I thought I was going to die. Honestly, I thought I was trapped in there," Estes told KCTV. "I saw the flames, and I was scared I was going to burn up. And then with all my might, I got this strength and lifted the rubble off."A utility crew investigating the odor had suggested that the restaurant close, but gave no sense of urgency or the potential for an explosion.The mayor confirmed that the fire department responded to a call about the gas odor, about 50 minutes before the blast, but left the scene after being told by the utility company that everything was under control."When these situations exist, the fire department defers to the expertise of any utility who is there," James said.Debris was stacked 3- to 4-feet high where the restaurant once stood. Among the rubble was the gas company's destroyed backhoe.Jennifer Carter, who was in the restaurant, told CNN affiliate KSHB that a man who had a hand-held device came in before the blast and told her and 10 others to leave. Employees had already turned off appliances after smelling gas, she said.Carter complied. She was just a few blocks away when she heard the explosion.The gas sent flames a few stories high into the night sky. More than 100 firefighters responded, Berardi said.Dr. Leonardo Lozada heard the explosion a block and a half away at St. Luke's Health Systems, where he is chief physician."It was pretty loud. I just heard it; it wasn't that traumatic," he said.The restaurant's owner, James Frantze, was in Oklahoma at the time of the blast. A message on the restaurant's Facebook page made a simple request of patrons:"Please keep our friends and families in your hearts and prayers."
