February 28, 2013The end of February coincides with the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI as head of the Roman Catholic Church. In Thursday's program, we explore what's next for Benedict and how his successor is chosen. We also mark the end of Black History Month with the unveiling of a Rosa Parks statue in the U.S. Capitol. Plus, we hear how one teenager's work ethic earned him a job opportunity while he was on his way to another.Teachers: We're looking for your feedback about CNN Student News.
