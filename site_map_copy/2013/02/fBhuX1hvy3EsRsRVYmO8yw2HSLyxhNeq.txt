February 19, 2013What happens to a meteor's energy when it enters the earth's atmosphere? We explore the science in Tuesday's program. Plus, we examine the origin of the sequester that's looming for the U.S. government, and we explain who might (and might not) be affected by the March 1 deadline. We also consider the pole position precedent that one driver is setting at this year's Daytona 500.Teachers: We're looking for your feedback about CNN Student News.
