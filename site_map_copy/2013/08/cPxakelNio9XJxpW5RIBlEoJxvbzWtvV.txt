But he also said he will be vindicated by "a full presentation of the facts" and that he would not step down.The outrage is overwhelming.Armed with clipboards and pens, volunteers hit the streets of San Diego over the weekend to begin collecting signatures for a recall effort. They need more than 101,000 signatures by September 26."We're going to be everywhere. We're going to be at sporting events.

Shannon was the latest person to accuse Filner."Every day that I went to work, I had butterflies in my stomach because I did not know what was going to happen the next time the mayor came by my desk," she told reporters last week."I have three sons, four grandsons and two great grandsons. As our mayor, you should be -- but are not -- a role model for any of them," Shannon said.Filner has rebuffed calls to resign from all nine City Council members and from fellow Democrats, including California's two U.S. senators.His supporters, which include some labor unions and Latinos, claim Filner is being denied due process, and the recall effort is orchestrated by those who oppose his political agenda.The mayor entered a two-week intensive behavior therapy program July 29, but his attorney, James Payne, said he was able to complete the voluntary program August 10. He was expected to continue with outpatient treatment, Payne said."Mayor Filner is taking personal time this week and is unavailable for comment, and we do not have information as to when he will be available for comment," said last week's statement from Payne's office, adding that it was not able to comment on the recall effort or other allegations leveled against the mayor.Filner is expected to return to work this week, but Payne did not immediately return a CNN e-mail asking exactly when he would be back in the office.The city attorney's office has said it could seek as a "last resort" a restraining order -- saying Filner creates a hostile environment for women -- to prevent him from returning to work, the Los Angeles Times reported.The city attorney's office did not return calls seeking comment.
