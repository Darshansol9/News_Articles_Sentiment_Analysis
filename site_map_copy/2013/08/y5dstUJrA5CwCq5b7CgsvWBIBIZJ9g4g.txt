MUST WATCH Memorial sees first MLK Day 01:41The completion of the work follows the removal of a controversial written message inscribed on the memorial's side.The memorial had originally included a paraphrase from the famed Civil Rights leader's "Drum Major" speech that read: "I was a drum major for justice, peace and righteousness."In 2011, famed poet Maya Angelou, a friend of King, pointed out that the statue took the original quote out of context in a manner that she said made King look arrogant.Two months before he was assassinated in 1968, King in fact said: "If you want to say that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter."The work at the site is expected to cost between $700,000 and $800,000, according to Bob Vogel, superintendent of the National Mall and Memorial Parks. The money is coming not from taxpayer dollars but from a fund established for repairs.The memorial, designed by Chinese artist Lei Yixin, opened in the summer of 2011. It features a large statue of King carved into the centerpiece "Stone of Hope," a large block set apart from the memorial's "Mountain of Despair," from which it appears to emerge.King gave his famous speech at the Lincoln Memorial on Aug. 28, 1963.
