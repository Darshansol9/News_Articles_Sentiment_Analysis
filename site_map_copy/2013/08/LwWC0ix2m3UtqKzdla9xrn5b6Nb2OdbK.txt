(CNN) -- The windmilling fists and stomping feet rain down blows on the 13-year-old boy.Trapped on the floor between the bus seats, he cries out as he receives fierce punch after vicious kick from the three bigger, older youths.But he doesn't physically step in to help.The bus driver, at least according to his school's policy, did nothing wrong.'Get somebody here quick'The attack took place July 9 in Pinellas County, Florida. But the horrific cell phone video -- and the surveillance video -- came out only recently.As the boy is pummeled, the bus driver John Moody yells at the assailants to leave the boy alone.He also asks dispatchers to send help."You gotta get somebody here quick, quick, quick, quick," he says. "They're about to beat this boy to death over here.""Please get somebody here quick. There's still doing it," he adds. "There's nothing I can do."Moody, 64, says he was too afraid to step in."The three boys just jumped on him and started pounding on him. And I did all can," he told CNN affiliate WFLA. "I was looking. It was like I was in shock. I was petrified."Not required to interveneThe ferocity of the attack left the 13-year-old with two black eyes and a broken arm."There was clearly an opportunity for him to intervene and or check on the welfare of the children or the child in this case and he didn't make any effort to do so," Chief Robert Vincent of Gulfport Police Department told the affiliate.According to Pinellas County school policy, the bus driver isn't required to intervene, only to call dispatch.He can step in, if he feels it's safe.Other counties actually forbid drivers from physically stopping fights.Follow @CNNschools on Twitter!
