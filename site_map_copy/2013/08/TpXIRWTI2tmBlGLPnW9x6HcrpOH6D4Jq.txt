Now, they're worried it could go up in smoke as a massive wildfire spreads."This is kind of a little paradise up here for us. ... To think this would all be gone would be devastating," Evans told CNN Sunday.Cradling their chihuahua, Cuervo, they prepared to leave the area on Sunday as more than 2,800 crew members struggled to corral the sprawling Rim Fire, which had devoured nearly 134,000 acres."It's scary," Loesch said. "You worry about the firefighters being on the line. ... It's overwhelming."The wildfire, which remained 7% contained, was spreading primarily to the northeast and east and threatened to grow amid extremely dry conditions and hot weather.After days of battling the blaze, things were looking up on Sunday, said Vickie Wright, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service."We're a long way from complete," she said, "but at least our boots on the ground are getting a better handle on it."JUST WATCHED Firefighters battle Yosemite wildfire Replay More Videos ...

It was not clear how many residents were covered by the evacuation advisory.Authorities say the Rim Fire started on August 17. The cause is under investigation.Yosemite spokesman Scott Gediman told CNN on Saturday that the Rim Fire's impact was restricted to a park entrance closure at Highway 120 West and a backcountry section used by hikers.The park typically has 15,000 visitors on a busy summer weekend. August sees an influx of visitors from other countries, a few of whom have called to check on conditions.Still, there's little indication so far it's keeping many people away.Ranger programs went on as normal Saturday and campgrounds were full."If somebody cancels, there are 10 people that will take their spot," said Gediman.Yosemite, with hundreds of campground sites and lodging units, had nearly 4 million visitors last year, according to the National Park Service.
