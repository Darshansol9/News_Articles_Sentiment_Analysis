The next day, the bodies of her mother, Christina Anderson, 42, and 8-year-old brother, Ethan, were found about 45 miles east of San Diego, in DiMaggio's burned house in Boulevard. The body of a dog was also recovered, police said.Her ordeal came to an end after a tip from horseback riders sent FBI agents swarming to a camping spot outside Cascade, Idaho.DiMaggio, the man investigators had sought in her disappearance, was shot in a confrontation with an FBI tactical agent.When asked what she would say to Ethan and her mother if she got a chance, her response was a reminder of her trauma."I wish I could go back in time and risk my life to try and save theirs," she said. "I will never forgive myself for not trying harder to save them."Those who know her say she spent some of her day helping to plan their funerals.Psychotherapist: 'In a numb state'Some experts questioned the wisdom of the online chats."This is a 16-year-old who's totally traumatized, she's in a state of trauma and so she's not thinking," psychotherapist Wendy Walsh said. "Sometimes in a numb state, you do things that you don't really consider the consequences."The teen even posted a selfie ... a self portrait of one's face posted online. She also engaged in lighter conversation, but even some of that seemed painful.What design did you get on your nails?"Pink for my mom and blue for Ethan," she said, referring to her 8-year-old brother.Ask.fm is a user-fueled, question-and-answer social media site, which claims to have 70 million users worldwide. Users can skip around the site asking people whatever they want, with the end result being profile pages that read like questionnaires.It has recently drawn heavy criticism as a hive of cyberbullying however, following several instances of teenage ask.fm members committing suicide after being harassed on the site. The suicide earlier this month of a 14-year-old British girl prompted UK Prime Minister David Cameron to call for a boycott of ask.fm. Several advertisers have also recently cut ties with the site, which allows users to remain anonymous.
