The bridge, which connects San Francisco and Oakland, will reopen Tuesday morning."Today is kind of the calm before the storm," said Bay Bridge spokesman Andrew Gordon, CNN affiliate KGO reported."We've kind of done as much as can really be done before closing the bridge and getting to those sections where there's currently live traffic. So there's kind of a lot of preparation and planning today," he said.Crews also will perform construction activities such as paving, striping and erecting barrier rail.The original eastern span has been in service since 1936. An earthquake in the late 1980s exposed its vulnerability.Once traffic is rerouted to the new span, the original one will be demolished, a process that is estimated to take three years."I think it's finally going to open. That's wonderful," Mary Yaco told CNN affiliate KPIX. "There's been plenty of warning, so I think that people should be all right."The Bay Bridge was also closed over the Labor Day weekend in 2006, 2007 and 2009.
