He said he was in one of the buildings at 6 a.m. Monday and the inside temperature was already close to 85 degrees.The closures affect about 1,300 students in kindergarten through fifth grade, he said.A malfunctioning air conditioner compressor in a Sioux Falls, South Dakota, elementary school forced teachers to dim the lights, close the blinds and use fans to keep things cool, said Sioux Falls School District spokeswoman DeeAnn Konrad.Plans are in place to move children in the affected classrooms to an air-conditioned private school across the street, she said.In hard-hit Iowa, schools in the central city of Marshalltown dismissed at midday Monday and planned to do the same Tuesday, school district spokesman Jason Staker said."Not all of our schools have buildingwide air conditioning," Staker told CNN. "When the temperatures outside reach into the high 90s like they did today, it doesn't take long for the temperature to rise in a classroom, especially when it's full of students."The cause of the heat wave is unusually strong high pressure over the northern Plains and parts of the Midwest, Hennen said.
