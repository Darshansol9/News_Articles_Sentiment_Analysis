She has also attended most of the weekly demonstrations dubbed "Moral Mondays," organized by the NAACP to voice anger about a key part of the state's GOP agenda. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory has dismissed Democratic criticism that he is only pushing a conservative agenda.Edmonds acknowledged the music and dancing were unrelated to the passage of any bills but said any celebration on the floor was "totally disrespectful and inappropriate" given the gravity of issues the General Assembly was discussing that day and earlier in the session."I thought that it pretty much summed up the whole session, how out of touch the legislators had been and the disconnect with their actions to the reality of the people's lives," she said. "They're making such sweeping changes that are ... hitting people of all walks of life really hard."Stam said in an e-mail to CNN that he received appreciative notes from Democratic representatives as well as Republicans about the young musician's performance. "We weren't discussing any issues. It was a recess. During that day we handled several dozen bills. ... I think the claim that it was inappropriate is silly."
