ESPN reported he is in negotiations with Major League Baseball over a possible suspension of his contract, the largest in the history of American sports."There is more than one party that benefits from me not ever stepping back on the field -- and that's not my teammates and it's not the Yankee fans," Rodriguez said Friday night at a news conference in Trenton, New Jersey, following a minor-league game that was supposed to prepare him to rejoin the New York Yankees.He would not specify the parties that stood to gain from banning him over the PED scandal, but he said, "when all this stuff is going on in the background and people are finding creative ways to cancel your contract and stuff like that, I think that's concerning for me."JUST WATCHED A-Rod: 'I'm going to keep fighting' Replay More Videos ...
