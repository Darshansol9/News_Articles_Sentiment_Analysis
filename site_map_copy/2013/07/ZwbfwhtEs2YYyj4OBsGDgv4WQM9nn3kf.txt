About a minute later, the caller said, it looked like the vehicle was catching fire.By the time a deputy arrived, Zimmerman and another man already had helped the two adults and two children out of the vehicle, Smith said.Zimmerman did not witness the crash, and he left after making contact with the deputy, Smith said. No injuries were reported in the crash.Zimmerman has been out of the public eye since a jury found him not guilty of second degree murder on July 13. His parents told ABC News last week that their family has received an "enormous amount of death threats."He fatally shot Martin in the Sanford neighborhood where Zimmerman and Martin's father lived in February 2012. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, had a confrontation with the unarmed African-American teen after calling police to report a suspicious person, and he said he shot Martin in self-defense.The case became a flash point in debates over racial profiling, and thousands attended vigils across the country over the weekend, decrying the verdict.Shawn Vincent, a spokesman for George Zimmerman's legal defense team, said when Zimmerman spoke with his attorneys on Friday, the car wreck didn't come up.The defense team, Vincent said, first heard of Zimmerman's involvement when media reports surfaced Monday.
