It was, 'if you want them come and take them,'" Kessler told the television station by telephone.Kessler has been the town's police chief for 14 years "without a mark against him," Hennon said."Like a lot of other people, I found the video a little vulgar. It was like watching an R-rated movie," she said."We have no policies regarding people's personal use outside of work, and we allow freedom of speech. What people do on their personal time is their business."Kessler, an outspoken gun rights advocate, has a history of making provocative statements. He has been featured in a number of online videos discussing his views, given numerous interviews and helped organize gun rights rallies.The police chief also has claimed in a number of interviews to be the founder of the Constitutional Security Force , a gun rights advocacy group.
