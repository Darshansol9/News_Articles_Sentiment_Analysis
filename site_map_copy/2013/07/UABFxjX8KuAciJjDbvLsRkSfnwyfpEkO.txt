Jackie Joyner-Kersee was born 10 years before Title IX. By the time she was in high school, Title IX allowed her to fully participate in high school track and field, where she set a record for the long jump. "Girls were able to practice right after school and we were able to pursue our dreams," she told CNN . She has broken records, won Olympic gold, and Sports Illustrated named her best female athlete of the 20th century. She credits Title IX for paving the way for the historic participation and wins by women in the 2012 Olympics. Kersee was an icon to Olympic gold medalist Allyson Felix, who won three gold medals in the 2012 Olympics.
