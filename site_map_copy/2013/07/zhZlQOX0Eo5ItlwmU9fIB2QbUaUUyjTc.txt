One person was transferred to a burn center and two people were admitted to the hospital and were in fair condition.Among those who were treated and released was a 17-month-old child. Injuries involved burns and shrapnel wounds, she said.Witness Annisa Wynn told CNN affiliate KTLA that fireworks suddenly began shooting sideways into the crowd instead of up into the air."The fireworks were so close, you could see them on the ground," Wynn said. "It never happens this way. People were screaming."The show, carried out by a pyrotechnics company, was part of an annual series of fireworks displays that began in the city in 1970, police Chief Mitch McCann said. Investigators were collecting evidence Friday, and the main investigation probably will begin Monday, Ventura County Deputy Fire Chief Mike LaPlant said.Another show in Windsor, Colorado, sparked flames that rose 10 feet high over parched land, witness Kami Gilmour said."The first embers dropped and looked like it might have started a small tree on fire," Gilmour said. "Then we realized there were six or seven fires all along the field, and then a gust of wind came and blew the fire all over the place. ... Our car was about 50 yards from it and covered in soot."There was no immediate word of injuries from the Colorado fire.Fireworks sever woman's foot in ChicagoAn apparent near-ground fireworks explosion severed a woman's foot and also seriously injured her sister-in-law in Chicago's West Lawn Park on Thursday night, CNN affiliate WGN reportedThe explosion severed the left foot of Kristina Perez, 32, and left fourth-degree burns on the left leg of Lorena Perez, 34, WGN said."One of the firecrackers, instead of going up, went to the ground and hit Kristina," her father, Eleuterio Carmona, told WGN.The women said they were watching a fireworks display at the park when the explosion happened.
