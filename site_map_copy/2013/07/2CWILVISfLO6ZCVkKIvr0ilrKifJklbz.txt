The heat wave that rolled through the Northeast last week killed at least four people in New York, the city's medical examiner reported Monday.The victims were all in their 80s.An 81-year-old Manhattan woman died Friday, while an 88-year-old man died Saturday on Staten Island and an 83-year-old woman died in the Bronx the same day, according to the medical examiner's office.The fourth fatality, an 84-year-old Brooklyn man, died Sunday, the medical examiner's office said.All died as a result of the high temperatures that roasted the Northeast last week, said Grace Brugess, a spokeswoman for the office. Temperatures peaked at 96 in New York on Friday and 93 on Saturday, with high humidity that drove the heat index up to or over the 100 mark.Hot weather is particularly dangerous to children, the elderly and people with heart and lung conditions, as air quality plummets while ozone levels soar.
