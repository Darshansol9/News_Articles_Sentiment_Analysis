Story highlights Search crews find body of a 48-year-old swimmer from HuntersvilleKayakers find girl who drowned in a swollen Catawba County creekFirst responders conduct swiftwater rescues to help people out of homes, carsThe body of a man swept away while swimming in a rain-swollen creek in western North Carolina was found Sunday, authorities said.The body of a child who was dragged away by the swift currents was recovered Saturday evening.The drownings happened after 4 inches of rain fell over five hours in North Carolina's Piedmont region, prompting officials to declare a state of emergency in Catawba County.First responders stayed busy racing to save people stuck in fast-moving waters and closed dozens of roads Saturday because of major flooding.Delilah Lovett, 10, of Charlotte and Juan Alberdi, 48, of Huntersville -- members of different families who were visiting the area together -- were both swimming in what is known as the "bathtub" on Wilson's Creek in Caldwell County around 6:15 p.m. Saturday, the Caldwell County Sheriff's Office said.JUST WATCHED Heavy rain floods NC counties Replay More Videos ...

The spokesman said the water rescue operation had been demobilized because waters were receding.
