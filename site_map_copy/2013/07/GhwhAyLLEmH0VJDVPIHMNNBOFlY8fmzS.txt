As was expected, Republican North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory signed into law Monday a controversial, restrictive abortion bill.The state's Senate and House of Representatives, both controlled by the Republican Party, passed the legislation earlier this month.The bill will place requirements on clinics that family planning advocates say would make it hard for them to stay in business.Among the requirements is the presence of a doctor when an abortion is being performed.
