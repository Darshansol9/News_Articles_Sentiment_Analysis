If you want to graduate from high school and go to an HBCU, even if it's not in Florida but especially Florida ... If you want to do that, I want to help you do that," Joyner said during his radio show Tuesday, referring to historically black colleges and universities."I will help you get tutors to get you out of high school, tutors to help you pass the SAT, and I will give you a full-ride scholarship to any HBCU you'd like."Jeantel, who said she might want to go into law enforcement, thanked Joyner.The host later appeared on CNN's "Piers Morgan Live" Tuesday night.He described how Jeantel's life has been turned upside down in the past year and half by Martin's death and the trial."We talked to her people today and it's going to take some work, first of all to get her a high school diploma, and get her ready for the SAT test, and then entered into college. But we are going to do that," he said."She deserves a chance," Joyner added.Jeantel said Monday t hat she was "disappointed, upset, angry, questioning and mad" at Zimmerman's acquittal.She found herself in an unforgiving spotlight of the nationally televised trial, during which viewers criticized her dress, her weight, her speech and her combative manner on the stand. She admitted to lying about her age and her reasons for skipping Martin's funeral.She called the verdict "BS" and said Martin, 17, was never aggressive."He was a calm, chill, loving person who loved his family, definitely his mother, and a good friend," Jeantel said.
