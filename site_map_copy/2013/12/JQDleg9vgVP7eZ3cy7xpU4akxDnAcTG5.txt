But authorities believe he died of his injuries during the boat journey, said Rod Antone of the Maui County mayor's office.JUST WATCHED Man on kayak killed by shark Replay More Videos ...

Aila Jr., chairman of the Board of Land and Natural Resources.Authorities say they have closed the waters off Makena State Recreation Area following the attack. Beaches in the area remain open, but the Natural Resources Department said people are advised to stay out of the water.The area will reopen at noon Tuesday if no more sharks are seen in the vicinity, the department said.The attack is the 13th shark incident reported in Hawaii this year, and the eighth on Maui, authorities said.That's well above the state's average of four unprovoked shark attacks per year over the past 20 years. The 10 incidents reported in 2012 were unprecedented at the time, the Natural Resources Department said."We are not sure why these bites are occurring more frequently than normal, especially around Maui," Aila said. "That's why we are conducting a two-year study of shark behavior around Maui that may give us better insights."Aila said authorities hope and expect "that numbers of incidents will return to a more normal range in the near future."
