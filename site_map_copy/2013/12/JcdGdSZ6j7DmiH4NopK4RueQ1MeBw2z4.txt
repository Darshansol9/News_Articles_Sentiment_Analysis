Story highlights UPS says it has cleared a holiday package backlogWeather and excessive volume contributed to the delaysAll holiday packages have been delivered, the company saysFedEx says "any isolated issues" with its deliveries are resolvedUPS on Friday finished delivering its backlog of holiday packages, company spokeswoman Natalie Godwin told CNN.The company earlier this week said that the volume of packages in its system exceeded its capacity, causing delays.The delays meant that some packages were not delivered before Christmas, despite promises by some retailers.UPS did not provide numbers, but the spokeswoman said the backlog was cleared Friday."Yes, the holiday packages have been delivered," Godwin said.The company considered Christmas Day deliveries as an emergency measure, but "after much thought and consideration" decided not to ask drivers to work on the holiday.The delays angered many customers, who took to social media to vent their frustrations.The company said that previous severe weather in the Dallas area had already created a backlog, and the holiday volume proved too much.FedEx was late with some deliveries as well, but called them "isolated incidents."On Saturday, FedEx reported that "any isolated issues are resolved."The U.S. Postal Service did not comment on whether it experienced any similar delays.
