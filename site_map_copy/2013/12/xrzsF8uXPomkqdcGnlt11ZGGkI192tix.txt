Story highlights Malfunctioning ammonia pump module must be repairedSaturday's spacewalk lasted 5 hours, 28 minutesThe astronauts will take another stroll on TuesdayThis was the 175th spacewalk taken to maintain the ISSTwo American astronauts spent 5 hours, 28 minutes working outside the International Space Station on Saturday in the first in a series of spacewalks needed to replace a malfunctioning ammonia pump module.Flight Engineers Rick Mastracchio and Mike Hopkins worked to remove the pump module, which had problems December 11 when an internal valve stuck in an incorrect position, NASA said on its website.They plan to go outside again Tuesday to replace the pump and might have to return once more to wrap up the job.The pump circulates ammonia through loops outside the station to keep equipment cool. The space station's life support system is up and running, but ISS operations were cut back as a result of the failure, NASA said.CNN's John Zarrella reported that NASA had concerns about the excursion because water built up in a European astronaut's helmet in July, causing that spacewalk to be cut short.JUST WATCHED ISS emergency spacewalk under way Replay More Videos ...
