"It really was old-fashioned police work combined with technology."The incident occurred on a parking deck of The Mall at Short Hills, police said, when attorney Dustin Friedland was walking with his wife to their 2012 silver Range Rover.Friedland was walking behind the vehicle after opening his wife's door and helping her get in when he was confronted, authorities said.A struggle ensued, authorities believe, and shots were fired.His wife heard the struggle and got out of the SUV, and the two attackers got in the vehicle and drove off. She was not injured.Friedland was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.The crime appears to have been motivated by the desire for that particular type of vehicle, Murray said.U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman added, "You have the right to be safe and the expectation that you should be safe in this county and the state of New Jersey and in particular you shouldn't have to worry that wherever you go...that somebody will put a gun to your head and take your car."All four men are currently being held at the Essex County Jail. If found guilty, the men could face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Bail has been set at $2 million for each defendant.
