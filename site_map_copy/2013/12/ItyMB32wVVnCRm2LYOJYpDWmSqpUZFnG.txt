The images go back to September, with the tip totals at more than $50,000.On Saturday, the anonymous tipper left a $1,000 tip on a $111 tab at Bo's Kitchen and Bar Room in New York. Manager Benjamin Cramer said the event certainly did happen but could not shed any light on the mystery tipper's identity."They seemed like perfectly normal clientele for our restaurant," Cramer told CNN.Earlier, at The NoMad restaurant in Manhattan's Flatiron District, the tipper left a $7,000 tip, though the restaurant manager declined to go into further detail.Back in October, the do-gooder left a $5,000 tip at a restaurant in Notre Dame, Indiana, and followed it up the next month with a $10,000 tip at a restaurant in Hollywood, California, according to managers at the two establishments.Various media outlets have reported that the generous donor may be former PayPal executive, Jack Selby, though you do not see the tipper in any of the Instagram images. CNN has not independently confirmed the tipper's identity.Valleywag.gawker.com posted what appears to be a screen grab of Selby's Facebook page from November 27: an image of Selby accompanied by a link he may have posted to a story about @TipsForJesus. A person who Valleywag said is one of Selby's friends commented on the link, "Do we win if we know whom is behind @tipsforjesus?"
