Michelin is recalling a specific size tire for commercial light trucks because a small number of the tires showed tread loss or rapid air loss, the manufacturer said Saturday.The tire is identified as Michelin LTX M/S LT 225/75R16 115/112R LRE and was produced between January 2010 and June 2012.The tires were sold as original equipment on some new trucks and as replacements on commercial light trucks, full-sized heavy duty vans, small RVs and some large pickup trucks, Michelin said.The tire maker urged removal of the tires as soon as possible. Motorists with the tires should visit an authorized Michelin retail location to have the tires replaced at no charge, the company said.
