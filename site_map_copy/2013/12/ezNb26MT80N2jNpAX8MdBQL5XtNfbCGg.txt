She said the mall wasn't extremely crowded, but once everyone started running it was chaos."It was the scariest moment of my life, without a doubt," Sagese said.The alleged shoplifter was apprehended, according to a mall spokesperson. The suspect had resisted arrest, and that situation led to the display case being knocked over, police said Tuesday afternoon.Police are continuing to investigate the incident, according to Jean Deluca, a spokeswoman for Nassau County Police Department. Three people fell on their hurried way out of the mall and suffered minor injuries; all three were treated and released, police said.Macy's did not respond to CNN's request for comment.This incident follows a fatal shooting at a New Jersey mall earlier this month.In September, the Roosevelt Field Mall was on lockdown at the request of police after a man shot and killed a business associate in a nearby building.
