"They were all released and ultimately not charged with any offense. Because it was a national issue -- black, white, male, female, people on the left and right, everybody was involved in it."In 1986, Rep. Ron Dellums, D-California, sponsored a bill that called for a full trade embargo against South Africa as well as divestment by American companies. The bill, which passed the House, was vetoed by then-President Ronald Reagan. Congress then overrode the veto.Today, this type of activism -- financial boycotts -- have become a protest staple. For example, fast food workers called this week for a boycott of their respective restaurants to protest low wages.POPULAR CULTUREThe music brought together such musical powerhouses as Bruce Springsteen, Run DMC, Bonnie Raitt, Miles Davis, George Clinton, Jackson Browne and dozens more to record the single and video.That was followed in 1986 with the release of Paul Simon's "Graceland," which featured South African musicians -- including Ladysmith Black Mambazo.JUST WATCHED Bernice King: Mandela was a gentle giant Replay More Videos ...

Morgan Freeman earned an Oscar nomination for best actor for his portrayal of Mandela in "Invictus."The latest to step into the role is Idris Elba, who plays the South African leader in "Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom.""What an honor it was to step into the shoes of Nelson Mandela and portray a man who defied odds, broke down barriers, and championed human rights before the eyes of the world," Elba said.POLITICSPerhaps nowhere is Mandela's influence more evident that on America's politicians.As a student at the University of California, Berkeley, California Assemblywoman Nancy Skinner participated in the divestment protests in the late 1970s and early 1980s.So when Mandela was released and the South African government began its transition, "I think we felt like were part of that," Skinner said.She learned of Mandela's death during a Democratic caucus in California."That strategic, spiritual, political leadership has no equal," she said.President Obama recounted to the nation on Thursday how he drew inspiration from Mandela during his first public speech."My very first political action, the first thing I ever did that involved an issue or a policy or politics, was a protest against apartheid. I studied his words and his writings," he said in a televised address shortly after Mandela's death was announced."And like so many around the globe, I cannot fully imagine my own life without the example that Nelson Mandela set, and so long as I live I will do what I can to learn from him.""He no longer belongs to us," Obama said. "He belongs to the ages."
