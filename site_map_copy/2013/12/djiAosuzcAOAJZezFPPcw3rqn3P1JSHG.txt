Brad Hoylman said to WABC.Despite the brouhaha, city officials are still supporting the event."It's what makes New York New York," Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said at a news conference Friday. "There has been some rowdy activity by a small handful of people."However, NYPD officers were handing out fliers stressing that they would stop revelers who publicly consume alcohol.SantaCon NYC is vowing to clean up its act."SantaCon has had growing pains," the event's organizers said in a news release on the NYC SantaCon website.
