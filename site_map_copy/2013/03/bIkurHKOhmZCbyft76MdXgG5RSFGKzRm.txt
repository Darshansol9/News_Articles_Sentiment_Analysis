The Center for Reproductive Rights and the ACLU of Arkansas say they will challenge in federal court a state ban on abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.Gov. Mike Beebe, a Democrat, vetoed the bill Monday, saying it "blatantly contradicts the United States Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court."However, the Arkansas Senate voted 20-14 Tuesday to override the veto, and the House followed suit Wednesday with a 56-33 override vote."We intend to make it ... clear that no one's constitutional rights are subject to revision by lawmakers intent on scoring political points, and that attempts such as this to turn back the clock on reproductive rights will not stand," Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a written statement.
