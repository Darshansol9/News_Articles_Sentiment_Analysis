(CNN) -- Teachers and parents share a common purpose: educating children.But differing beliefs, expectations and methods can make collaboration more challenging.A 2011 story published on CNN.com by author and teacher Ron Clark, entitled " What teachers really want to tell parents ," looked at reasons why educators give up on their field.He asserted that negativity from parents places undue pressure on teachers and advised greater cooperation."We are educators, not nannies," Clark wrote. "We are educated professionals who work with kids every day and often see your child in a different light than you do. If we give you advice, don't fight it."His opinion consistently resonated with readers over the next couple of years, which made it one of CNN's most-shared stories on Facebook. The story has been recommended more than 898,000 times.Clark founded the Ron Clark Academy in Atlanta and was named "American Teacher of the Year" by Disney and a "Phenomenal Man" by Oprah Winfrey.But even Clark's status as a leader in his field didn't fully explain why this story captivated people, so CNN revisited the idea with Facebook users last week by asking them to finish this sentence: "The one thing parents/teachers really need to know is _____."
