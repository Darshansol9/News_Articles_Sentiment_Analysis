March 12, 2013We begin Tuesday's show in Asia, as North Korea backs out of a 60-year-old truce and Japan marks a tragic anniversary. We also explore the impact of ocean debris on land and at sea, and we visit an Ohio community that's grieving after a deadly car crash involving teenagers. Finally, we hear how scientists are reaching thousands of years into the past to study a disease we face today.Teachers: We're looking for your feedback about CNN Student News.
