On Thursday, CNN Student News takes you inside a U.S. Supreme Court hearing on same-sex marriage. We also report on the first female director of the U.S. Secret Service, and we consider when electronics can be used during flights. Plus, we discuss an attack against a teacher at an all-girls' school in Pakistan. And we hear how an American teenager expanded her cheerleading squad to include disabled students.Teachers: We're looking for your feedback about CNN Student News.
