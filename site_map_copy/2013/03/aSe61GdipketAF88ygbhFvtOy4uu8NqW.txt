"And when I say infested, I mean infested. People were in the aisles literally brushing roaches off of them.""We thought it was one.

We have spoken with each passenger and provided full refunds."Greyhound has apologized for the inconvenience to the 48 passengers on board the bus, which departed Atlantic City around 10 a.m. Friday."We are investigating how they got there -- in bags or from the bus," said Richmond.What caused the insects to start pouring out of the air vents about 15 minutes into the journey is not yet clear -- nor what Greyhound plans to do to get rid of them.Alexander told WABC she was sitting in the back of the bus when she saw those toward the front starting to panic."Then after a while, the panic got towards the back because we all started looking around and saw roaches crawling everywhere," she said.According to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, roaches "are common even in the cleanest of crowded urban areas and older dwellings" and are found in all types of neighborhoods.Happily, the pests don't usually hitch a ride on a bus to the Big Apple.
