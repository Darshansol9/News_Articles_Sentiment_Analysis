March 20, 2013In Wednesday's program, we explain why Iran is a likely topic of discussion during President Obama's first trip to Israel since taking office. Plus, as Pope Francis officially begins his papacy, we consider the challenges of protecting a pope. We also examine why a 135-year-old White House tradition might be canceled, and we mark the start of spring with a report on the vernal equinox.Teachers: We're looking for your feedback about CNN Student News.
