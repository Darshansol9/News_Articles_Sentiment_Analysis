Story highlights A tiny Portland, Oregon, park loses its only tree to theftAt just 2 feet across, Mill Ends Park is billed as the world's smallestA newspaper columnist started the park in an abandoned street light hole in 1948The city took it over in 1976The last time Mill Ends Park was in the news, it was full of teeny-tiny plastic police officers, a whole lot of teeny-tiny protest signs, and one scrawny evergreen tree.That's the kind of place it is, all 452 square inches of it.What's billed as the world's smallest park, tucked inside a concrete circle just 2 feet across, is a quirky Portland kind of place.It's the site of itty-bitty protests -- including that 2011 Occupy Portland protest covered by CNN affiliate KATU -- teensy-weensy swimming pools and way small diving boards -- for the diminutive butterflies, of course.And then, for a short time it seems, someone stole its lone tree. The diminutive evergreen disappeared sometime last week from the downtown street-corner park, KATU reported , citing the Portland Parks and Recreation Department.It was more of a crisis than you might think: The place is also reputedly the home of leprechaun Patrick O'Toole, whom the late Oregon Journal columnist Dick Fagan claimed granted him a wish of having his own park.According to the parks department , Fagan planted flowers in an unused hole in the median outside his newsroom office way back in 1948.JUST WATCHED World's smallest park loses lone tree Replay More Videos ...

"We will pursue ... our investigation and hope that justice is served, and served swiftly".
