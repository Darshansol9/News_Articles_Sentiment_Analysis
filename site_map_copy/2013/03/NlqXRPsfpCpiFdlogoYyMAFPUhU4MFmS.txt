Story highlights Harvard searches the administrative accounts of resident deansCollege says it was looking for the source of a leak amid a cheating scandalNews of the search draws immediate criticism from some members of Harvard's facultyA cheating scandal at Harvard College just got bigger, and this time the focus is flipped: Administrators, not students, are under fire.On Monday, the school apologized for the way it handled a secret search of the e-mail accounts of resident deans. It conducted the search in an effort to find who leaked information about the scandal to the media last year."While the specific document made public may be deemed by some as not particularly consequential, the disclosure of the document and nearly word-for-word disclosure of a confidential board conversation led to concerns that other information -- especially student information we have a duty to protect as private -- was at risk," said a statement from Deans Michael D. Smith and Evelynn M. Hammonds."Consequently, with the approval of the dean of FAS (Faculty of Arts and Sciences) and the University General Counsel, and the support of the dean of Harvard College, a very narrow, careful, and precise subject-line search was conducted by the University's IT department," they added.Smith and Hammonds stressed that the search was limited to administrative accounts, and that it did not involve a review of e-mail content.JUST WATCHED 2012: Students accused of cheating Replay More Videos ...

He described the way the school handled the case as dishonorable."Why not tell people you are reading their e-mail? Would it not be the honorable thing to do? What is to be gained by not doing that? Other than avoiding, perhaps, the embarrassment of acknowledging that you are doing something to which the targets would reasonably object if they knew it," he wrote.Attempts to contact Harvard for details on Monday on the search and the handling of it were unsuccessful.Last month, the school announced that more than half the students implicated in the cheating scandal had been required to withdraw for a time.The class was Government 1310: Introduction to Congress, according to The Harvard Crimson, the school's student newspaper.Many of those who were not forced to withdraw faced disciplinary probation at the Ivy League institution in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the remaining were cleared.
