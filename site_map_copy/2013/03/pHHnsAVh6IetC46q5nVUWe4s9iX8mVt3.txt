March 6, 2013Wednesday's program leads off with reports on the death of a world leader and a record-setting day on Wall Street. Next, we explore how looks can be deceiving when it comes to sinkholes. We also examine tension between North and South Korea, including a threat to break the truce that ended the Korean War. Plus, we hear why some scientists wanted to get their hands on a great white shark.Teachers: We're looking for your feedback about CNN Student News.
