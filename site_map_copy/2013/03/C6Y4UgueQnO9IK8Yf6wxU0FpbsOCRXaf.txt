We've got a beautiful view and we'd hate to see our view and house head into the ocean."According to Barker, the neighborhood had above-average rainfall over the winter and into spring. A snowfall late last week left several inches of wet snow that was gone.The homes are on a seismic fault that on rare occasions shifts, said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers.Barker said the cliff has not seen movement for many years. "We just thought OK, that is something you pay for the marvelous view that you have."Fire officials first received a call about the slide shortly after 4 a.m., Hartin said. Residents reported hearing a sound like thunder around the time of the slide, CNN affiliate KING-TV reported.A spokesman with the Washington State Department of Natural Resources said a team of geologists is on its way to Whidbey Island to investigate.The cause of the landslide was not immediately clear. There hasn't been rain in the past few days, said Hartin.
