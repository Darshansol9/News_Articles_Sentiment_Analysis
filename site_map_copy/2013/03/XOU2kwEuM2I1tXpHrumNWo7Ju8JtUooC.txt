Essentially the $40,000 is for the value of the truck, Jonas' fees, compensation for the time the women have gone without a truck and other matters.Jonas waived his fees, which would have amounted to about $25,000, he said."We wanted to get this issue resolved because it is draining a lot of energy," Jonas said.He would not comment on how much the women will seek in compensation for their physical injuries and emotional distress.Dorner died February 12 while holed up in a cabin that caught fire when police fired tear gas canisters into it. Days before, he had killed four people and wounded three others as part of a vendetta against his former comrades before apparently taking his own life in the cabin.
