"He was beaten, but not badly."The medical examiner added he didn't know how the family came to the conclusion that McMillian was dragged and burned.The late politician's family, in the statement released through his former campaign manager Jarod Keith, called for "a full and thorough investigation." They said McMillian had told "family and close friends that he was very concerned for his personal safety.""We feel that this was not a random act of violence, based on the condition of the body when it was found," they said. "Marco, nor anyone, should have their lives end in this manner."Yet Meredith insisted "this was not a targeted attack.""No way," the medical examiner said. "This was more of a personal dispute."The Coahoma County Sheriff's Office announced on Thursday that a suspect, Lawrence Reed, faces a murder charge in the death.Lawrence Reed, 22, has been charged in the murder of Marco McMillian, authorities said.Reed, 22, was found in McMillian's wrecked SUV on Tuesday morning and was taken to a hospital.McMillian's Facebook page shows a glimpse at a man who was politically ambitious.
