A teenage girl at the center of an alleged rape by two star Steubenville, Ohio, high school football players took the stand Saturday to testify.High school football players Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, are accused of raping the girl, who prosecutors contend was drunk, during a series of end-of-summer parties in August 2012.According to prosecutors, Richmond and Mays each penetrated the victim's vagina with their fingers, an act that constitutes rape under Ohio law. Attorneys for the two boys say they are innocent.The trial, in its fourth day, has gained national attention because of the lurid text messages, cell phone pictures and videos and social media posts that appeared to document the alleged sexual abuse of the girl.
