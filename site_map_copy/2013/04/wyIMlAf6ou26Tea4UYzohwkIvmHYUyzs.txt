Eddie Jordan was named Tuesday as Rutgers University's new men's basketball coach -- a position recently held by Mike Rice, who was fired this month after video surfaced showing him shoving and berating players during practice.Jordan is currently an assistant coach with the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers. A Rutgers alumnus, he previously served as head coach of NBA franchises in Sacramento, Washington and Philadelphia.The Rutgers basketball program had been the focus of national scrutiny after ESPN aired a video that it said shows parts of practice sessions between 2010 and 2012. Its contents -- showing Rice physically and verbally abusing players -- initially earned the coach a three-game suspension, a $75,000 fine and a ticket to anger management classes.
