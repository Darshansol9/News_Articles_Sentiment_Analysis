Story highlights Bombing suspect Dzohkhar Tsarnaev questioned before court appearanceRepublican lawmaker concerned that questioning may have been cut off too earlySource: Miranda warning given to Tsarnaev at hospital bedsideLaw allows for limited questioning if there is imminent danger of attackThe Justice Department faces questions over whether it prematurely ended interrogation of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzohkhar Tsarnaev before a court appearance at his hospital bed.House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers said he was "concerned that these proceedings, which included mandatory administration of Miranda rights, could have been conducted in a manner that prematurely cut off a lawful, ongoing FBI interview."Tsarnaev faced a judicial "first appearance" on Monday at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center three days after being taken into custody for the April 15 bombing that killed three people and injured more than 260 others.A government source familiar with the first appearance says the Miranda warning, which advises criminal suspects of their constitutional rights against self-incrimination, were first administered while a magistrate judge presided over the hearing.Government officials indicated Tsarnev, 19, was not immediately apprised of those rights after his capture late last Friday, under what is called the "public safety" exception.JUST WATCHED Breaking down the investigation Replay More Videos ...

"It's a dangerous precedence setting that I think we need to change and correct right away. And we still need more answers on this particular question."Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd also confirmed the U.S. attorney's sequence of events."Following the filing of the criminal complaint in this matter on Sunday, the court, that evening, scheduled an initial appearance for Monday, which it then coordinated with the prosecutors, federal defender, court reporter, U.S. Marshal Service and the hospital."The Rules of Criminal Procedure require the Court to advise the defendant of his right to silence and his right to counsel during the Initial Appearance. The prosecutors and FBI agents in Boston were advised of the scheduled initial appearance in advance of its occurrence," Boyd said in a statement.Generally, suspects charged with crimes in an initial criminal complaint are to be brought before court within "one business day," even those hospitalized like Tsarnaev.The public safety exception does not set a hard time when questioning must stop and the suspect must be taken into court, but it's generally understood to be about 48 hours. The government would have to justify holding anyone longer than that under the exception.The court case is U.S. v. Tsarnaev (13-2106).
