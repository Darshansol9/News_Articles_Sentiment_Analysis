It is easy, in the initial aftermath of the bombings, to make careless associations between identity and motive, similar to post 9/11 reaction.But this time, there is a change in rhetoric of how potential suspects are identified, particularly if they are Muslim. It is because of this change we are learning to move past paralyzing fear and maturing in how we think of what it means to be American.He was not alone in being targeted after 9/11.Study after study also shows that Muslims who are engaged with their mosque and in their communities tend to be more civically engaged, like the Muslim leader who recently thwarted an attack in Canada.There are reports that perhaps he was radicalized, connected to a larger network of individuals and influenced by abhorrent videos that may have been a motivation.There is more to be learned.But America is reacting differently to this suspect than to American Muslims after 9/11. This is in part because American Muslims are much more visibly engaged in political and civil society structures, and that active engagement has also resulted in a more confident expression of what it means to be American and Muslim. In the immediate aftermath of the bombing, the Islamic Center of Boston Cultural Center provided 40 medical professionals and volunteered the center as a disaster relief area.This time, there seemed to be more acknowledgement that these tragedies really are orchestrated by all sorts of Americans. While there are reports of attacks on Muslim Americans, and fears of further attacks against Muslims and Sikhs, it has not been to the extent of fear after 9/11.There has also been a more sophisticated discussion about how these brothers were acting in an American mold, following the boys of Columbine.Along with college students, prominent clerical and political figures are actively speaking out against Islamophobia and indiscriminate hate against Muslims.These are all signs of confidence from within the American Muslim community, and that comes with support and acceptance of the broader society that Muslims are American.This change in rhetoric around looking for simple answers gives me hope. It means we are healing from the tragedy of 9/11 – and growing stronger.The sad fact is that we cannot predict attacks like this, as much as we would like to. The best we can do is build true communities that are resilient and where we recognize that being American does not mean one ethnicity or faith.We are looking to create something better, and not live in fear.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hussein Rashid.
