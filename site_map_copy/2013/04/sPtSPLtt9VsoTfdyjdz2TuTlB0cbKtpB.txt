It's not clear what he did while in Russia, but Tsarnaev's father has said his son was with him at all times.Officials have said they're worried about what might have happened on the trip."What I'm very concerned about is that when he went over there, he very well may have been radicalized and trained by these Chechen rebels, who are the fiercest jihad warriors," said Rep.

On Sunday, McCaul said he thought it was likely Tsarnaev made other trips to the region. "We know he's starting to radicalize in 2009. ... I could speculate that he was probably going over there more often. We don't have -- I don't have the evidence of that just yet. But that's obviously an area of focus," he said. "I know the intelligence community is scrubbing through all their records and that travel is very important, just given who the Chechen rebels are."August 2012Soon after returning from a long visit to Russia, Tsarnaev creates a YouTube channel with links to a number of videos. Two videos under a category labeled "Terrorists" have since been deleted. It's not clear when or by whom.Analysis by CNN and the SITE Intelligence Institute has uncovered a screen grab from one of those videos. It features members of the group Imarat Kavkaz -- identifiable by the logo on their shirts. Imarat Kavkaz is the most potent militant Islamist group in the north Caucasus, which includes Chechnya and Dagestan.Tsarnaev also appears to have posted and then removed a video of a militant named Abu Dujana, a jihadist leader who was later killed by Russian troops.Russian security services killed Abu Dujana in December during an assault on an apartment in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan. He led a small militant group in Dagestan that had links to Imarat Kavkaz.While Tsarnaev was in Russia in 2012, he spent some of his time in Makhachkala, where his father lives today.

After the sermon, Tsarnaev repeatedly argues his viewpoint with the preacher, then leaves.January 18, 2013When a preacher at the same mosque says slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. was a great person, Tsarnaev stands up, shouts and calls him a "non-believer," the Islamic Society of Boston said. Tsarnaev accuses the preacher of "contaminating people's mind" and calls him a hypocrite. People in the congregation shout back at Tsarnaev, telling him to "leave now."
