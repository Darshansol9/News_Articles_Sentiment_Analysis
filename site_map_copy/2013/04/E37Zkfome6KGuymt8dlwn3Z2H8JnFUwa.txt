I just kept asking, 'what is ricin? What did I do?'"Curtis' attorney, Christi McCoy, said her client has been framed by someone who used several phrases Curtis likes to use on social media.The letters read, in part: "To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance."They were signed "I am KC and I approve this message," a source told CNN.They each had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address.McCoy said she was sure someone else was to blame."I do believe that someone who was familiar and is familiar with Kevin just simply took his personal information and did this to him," McCoy said. "It is absolutely horrific that someone would do this."Curtis said it was an eye-opener for him."I think now, how many people are thrown in jail because of circumstantial evidence and someone can frame you that easily," he said.Curtis had been accused of sending letters containing "a suspicious granular substance" to Obama; Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi; and Sadie Holland, a Justice Court judge in Lee County, Mississippi.The FBI said the substance tested positive for ricin, a toxin derived from castor beans that has no known antidote.No illnesses had been found as a result of exposure to the toxin.
