That plan proposed bringing a 500-ton asteroid closer to Earth.Obama supports NASA's plan and is including about $100 million in his proposed budget to kick it off, the senator said.The president has previously said that he wants to send astronauts to an asteroid for the first time by 2025.NASA's plan would bump that date up by four years to 2021, according to Nelson's office.The proposal may have gotten an unexpected boost in February when an asteroid exploded over Russia, injuring more than 1,000 people, causing millions of dollars in damage and sparking fresh concerns about the severity of space threats.
