April 12, 2013As CNN Student News wraps up the week, we report on severe weather sweeping across the U.S., we discuss the newest Medal of Honor recipient, and we hear how relics discovered in London can offer clues about life in the Roman Empire. We also visit a Georgia county where students are organizing their school's first integrated prom. And we share the story of how two teenagers rescued their father from underneath an overturned tractor.Teachers: We're looking for your feedback about CNN Student News.
