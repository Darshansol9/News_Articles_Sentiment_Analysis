April 18, 2013Thursday's show begins with the latest developments surrounding Monday's terrorist attack in Boston. We also explore how technology could play a role in the investigation, and we discuss the heroic efforts of people who came to others' aid. Plus, we report on suspicious letters sent to the White House and U.S. Capitol, and we take some time for rhyme as we mark National Poetry Month.Teachers: We're looking for your feedback about CNN Student News.
