Ron King of Port Canaveral Police Department was fired Friday after an internal review investigated how he offered the hoodie paper shooting targets to two fellow officers, said John Walsh, interim CEO of the Canaveral Port Authority.The officers, who saw King with the targets in his police vehicle, declined the offer, Walsh said."Port Canaveral Police Department considers that behavior unacceptable," Walsh said of King's conduct.King couldn't be immediately reached for comment.In February 2012, Martin, 17, was shot and killed in Sanford, Florida, by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain who is awaiting trial on a second-degree murder charge in Martin's death.Martin family attorney Ben Crump condemned the use of the targets."It is absolutely reprehensible that a high-ranking member of the Port Canaveral Police, sworn to protect and serve Floridians, would use the image of a dead child as target practice," Crump said in a statement. "Such a deliberate and depraved indifference to this grieving family is unacceptable."Walsh said the Canaveral Port Authority plans to apologize to the Martin family.King brought two of the targets to a firearms training session on April 4 at the Brevard Community College campus in Cocoa, Florida, CNN affiliate WFTV reported.King, who bought the targets on the Internet, and other officers at the training site were on duty at the time, the affiliate said.
