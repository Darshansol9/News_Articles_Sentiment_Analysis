The United States has delayed a "long-planned" missile test, with a senior U.S. defense official saying the move was "prudent and wise to ... avoid any misperception or chance of manipulation" in light of ongoing friction with North Korea.The official said that the test "was never associated with North Korea to begin with," but that the United States decided to hold off "given recent tensions on the Korean Peninsula.""The U.S. will conduct another test soon and remains strongly committed to our nuclear deterrence capabilities," the official said.
