The documents didn't specify where the money was from.The discovery was the latest twist in a story that started Thursday.The incident played out in one of the most heavily policed places in the world, temporarily locked down Congress and sparked anxiety among tourists and staffers alike.Police say Carey rammed barricades and police cruisers -- actions Washington police Chief Cathy Lanier said appeared deliberate -- and sped down Pennsylvania Avenue before crashing. Two law enforcement officers were injured.An officer attempted to block her car with a bicycle rack, but Carey pushed over the rack, knocking the officer to the ground, according to the documents filed Tuesday.She entered a traffic circle against the flow of traffic, and had been driving in reverse when she was fatally shot.Carey's boyfriend reportedly told police last winter that she appeared to be delusional.

The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was not authorized to release details to the media.Reports have surfaced following the deadly incident that Carey was being treated for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, claims her family has vehemently denied.Her family has questioned whether shooting Carey was the only way to end the chase."We want to know if protocols were followed," family attorney Eric Sanders said last week on CNN's AC360."We are interested in finding out what happened. ...We are going to conduct our investigation, and we are not going to go with just what the government said."Police Chief Lanier has said that officers of the U.S. Capitol Police and Secret Service acted within commonly accepted use-of-force policies and practices in reaction to an intentional series of violent acts.
