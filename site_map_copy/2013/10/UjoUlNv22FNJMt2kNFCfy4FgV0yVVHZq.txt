No word if any of the cannons was loaded.They likely will be added to the Queen Ann's Revenge exhibit in Beaufort, which has more than 280,000 artifacts.Romanticized in history books as a notorious ruffian, Blackbeard, born in Britain, terrorized Atlantic seafarers from the shores of the American colonies to the Caribbean.Blackbeard survived after the ship was intentionally grounded in June 1718. He left hundreds of his crew marooned, sort of an 18th century corporate downsizing, and apparently took most of the booty.The Queen Anne's Revenge's remains are scuttled two miles off the North Carolina coast in 25 feet of water.Blackbeard made it six more months before he was killed in a battle with British troops. His severed head was displayed on the bowsprit of the victors' ship.
