The prosecutor's office didn't say what that alleged misconduct was.Patton was then told to return government-owned equipment thought to be in his government vehicle, according to officials.A Tennessee National Guard member yelled out "gun" when he saw Patton accessing a "fanny pack" as he came back from the car, federal prosecutors saidA senior non-commissioned officer then tried to subdue Patton, who managed to get off a few shots -- hitting three National Guard personnel in the room -- according to the prosecutor's office. Millington police Chief Rita Stanbeck had said Thursday that two people were shot, one in the foot and the other in the leg.The suspect got away and ran, but not far. The officer was able to catch and hold him until Millington police arrived.If convicted on the assault charge, Patton could be sentenced to as many as 20 years in federal prison. He could get another 10 years on the firearm charge.The armory north of Memphis is on property leased to the Guard by the U.S. Navy, which has its personnel and recruiting commands across the road. The shooting prompted a temporary lockdown of the Navy compound.
