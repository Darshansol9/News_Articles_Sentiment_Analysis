He declined to give further information regarding the claim.Perecman also told CNN that he is taking steps to investigate how Oquendo was able to escape school grounds unsupervised."Right now, we have submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the city and the various agencies involved, in order to obtain the information for us to know what occurred," Perecman said.However, the family remains resolute in their search for their missing son."I'm just doing my job as their lawyer, but the focus is on finding Avonte. That is the family's focus," Perecman said.Earlier this week, Oquendo's mother called the situation "heartbreaking.""I just need to find my son because he needs his family, he cannot fend for himself out there," Vanessa Fontaine told CNN affiliate WABC"This is just the hardest thing to have your child disappear, and you cannot bring him home with you," she said.According to the surveillance video provided by the NYPD, no supervisor or monitor stopped the 14-year-old when he ran out."He is supposed to have one-to-one supervision at all times," Fontaine said through tears. "He has the mental capacity of a 7- or 8-year-old."The New York City Department of Education issued a statement saying it is working closely with the police on the investigation.The school is not commenting.Police say Oquendo was last seen wearing a gray-striped shirt, black jeans and black sneakers. He is 5 feet, 3 inches tall and weighs 125 pounds.Missing posters are being handed out and the surrounding areas are under investigation, WABC reported."He doesn't know that, you know, 'I can get hurt in the street, someone can grab me and take me.'
