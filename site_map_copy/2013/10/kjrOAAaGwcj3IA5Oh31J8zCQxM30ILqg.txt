It was later determined that he had no connection to the initial threat. The man was arrested on unrelated charged, the FBI said in its statement.The third event involved a disruptive passenger on an out-bound flight. No arrests were made in that case, and it was also determined not to have anything to do with the other two incidents, the FBI said.After the airport was evacuated, some arriving flights were diverted and some passengers who were on planes that had already landed were taken to hotels.Hours later, officials issued an all-clear."We erred on the side of caution in terms of doing whatever's necessary to make sure that everybody is safe," said Stewart.
