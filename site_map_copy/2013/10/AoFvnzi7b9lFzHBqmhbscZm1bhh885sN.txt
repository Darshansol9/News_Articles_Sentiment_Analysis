"It shot flames out 20 feet to the side. At that point the gondola really started to drop."This is not the first incident during this year's balloon fiesta, according to the affiliate. On Saturday, a balloon hit a power pole. On Sunday, a balloon hit power lines, KRQE reported. But in those cases, both balloons were able to make safe landings.
