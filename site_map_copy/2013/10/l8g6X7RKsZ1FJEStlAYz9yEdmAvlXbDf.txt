He is currently being held on immigration-related charges, according to the FBI.According to a federal affidavit, the 36-hour drama began with two armed men demanding money and jewelry from Ayvani's mother. When the mother did not comply, the men took Ayvani, the affidavit said.The same men later returned the girl unharmed to her aunt's house in Conyers, Georgia, the affidavit said. It remains unclear whether the abduction was random.Phone calls abductors made to Ayvani's family demanding ransom and drugs allowed authorities to trace their phone records, which they said led to Jackson's arrest the next day.Authorities have not detailed how the men were arrested.
