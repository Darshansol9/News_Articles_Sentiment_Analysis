The body of Lincoln's killer, John Wilkes Booth, was examined and identified on a ship moored at there.Amid World War I, the Yard made Navy ordnance, including the 14-inch naval railway guns used in France in the war.In the years after World War II and into the Cold War era, the Yard's military role lessened.
