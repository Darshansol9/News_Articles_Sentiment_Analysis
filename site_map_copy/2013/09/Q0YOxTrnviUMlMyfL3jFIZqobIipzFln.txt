Infected patients are diagnosed with primary amoebic meningoencephalitisNaegleria fowleri associated with disinfected public drinking water has caused deaths in only one other case in the United States, according to the CDC . The water came from an untreated drinking water system in Arizona; two children died there in 2003.Flushing water linesParishes along the Gulf Coast began flushing water lines with chlorine last week.The Mississippi boy contracted amoebic meningoencephalitis and died last month. Tests at the home where he was playing found the Naegleria fowleri amoeba.Officials said less than 1% of patients survive the deadly brain infection, but an experimental drug from the CDC has shown promise in fighting it. Kali Hardig, a 12-year-old in Arkansas, survived after contracting the amoeba in July, possibly at a Little Rock water park.The first symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis appear one to seven days after infection, including headache and fever.
