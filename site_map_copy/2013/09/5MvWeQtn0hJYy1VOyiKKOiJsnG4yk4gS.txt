The Justice Department will stop enforcing a federal law that prohibits the Veterans Affairs Department from providing benefits to same-sex married couplesAttorney General Eric Holder, in a letter addressed to House Speaker John Boehner, advised lawmakers that the Obama administration believes the Supreme Court's decision in June to overturn a key provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act -- specifically Section 3 that dealt with federal benefits, and that defined marriage for federal purposes as only between one man and one woman -- also nullifies a separate federal law that defines marriage as between a man and a woman for the purposes of veterans benefits.(Other parts of DOMA -- including the provision that states not be forced to recognize same-sex marriage laws in other states -- still remain in effect, at least for now.)Holder said the Justice Department also has concluded the VA statute to be unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment.JUST WATCHED Cheney vs. Cheney on same-sex marriage Replay More Videos ...

But Holder, in his letter, said the law contains the same language as that struck down by the Supreme Court.Holder noted that a recent federal court ruling that struck down the VA ban and that a group of lawmakers who were seeking to defend the DOMA law has withdrawn its defense of the VA statute.
