The change takes effect January 1.The BSA, however, will maintain its ban on gay adult leaders.The National Jewish Committee on Scouting, the United Church of Christ, the Episcopal Church, the Unitarian Universalist Association and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which sponsors more Scout units than any other faith, all endorsed the change.Faith-based organizations charter more than 70% of Scout chapters, providing meeting space and leadership, according to the BSA."There have been some organizations that have decided not to renew their charters with Scouting," BSA spokesman Deron Smith said in May. "But we can't quantify the impact of the amended policy."Not anti-BSADespite its Genesis, Trail Life USA says it's not "anti-BSA," nor its name is meant to be "political or controversial." The theme of the weekend conference was: "Honoring the Legacy, Raising the Standard."Yet, the group is clear on the stand it's taking."Our whole life is about the trail, both in the outdoors and in the journey of life as believers," said John Stemberger, chairman of the board for the organization, and also founder of On My Honor, a group that opposed the Scout's change in policy."So Trail Life is a way of life that is centered on following Christ in the outdoors."
