MUST WATCH Feds: Boston man plotted to eat children 03:46It was these chats -- which included discussions about abducting, raping, murdering and eating children, according to court documents -- that put Portway on the radar screen of police.His home in Worcester was searched last year and authorities found tens of thousands of computer images and videos of child pornography, 4,500 exchanges of child pornography between Portway and the people he chatted with online. The images included children purportedly being cooked and prepared to be eaten, court documents said.Authorities also found a locked basement, court documents show. Photos taken the day of Portway's arrest show a narrow wooden staircase leading downstairs to a soundproof room in which he planned to imprison children. The room was furnished with a metal cage with a circular hole for feeding, a rusted and worn steel-topped table, as well as multiple kinds of metal bondage equipment. A child-sized coffin made of plywood was found on the floor nearby.Also found in the house were handcuffs, rope intended for bondage, mouth gags, and castration tools. A large box of frozen raw chicken, near a handful of disposable scalpels, was photographed by investigators near two industrial-sized freezers.In the kitchen, a jug of Clorox bleach was seen by the doorway, while a red child-sized 'onesie' lay on the countertop, amid snacks and disposable syringes. A butcher kit containing plastic gloves, an apron, cutting board, bone saw, cleaver, shears, and multiple knives was photographed in the sink.Portway's collection of DVDs and books appear to echo his intentions to ensnare, rape, and cannibalize children. Among his DVD collection were titles such as "Human Beast," "Hansel and Gretel," "The Real Cannibal Holocaust," "The Genesis Children," "Cannibal the Musical," and "Cannibal Ferox," a film with the tagline "Make them die slowly." Portman's DVD copy of the film "Albert Fish: In Sin He Found Salvation" had a note written on it: "Will, let's do lunch."Online chats, seized by police, showed Portway calling his basement a "dungeon" where he intended to "keep kidnapped children while he sexually abused them and as a place to eventually murder and cannibalize the children," authorities said.Two other men who chatted with Portway have already been convicted. One was a puppeteer who, authorities said, plotted with Portway to kidnap children the puppeteer knew from his work at a Florida church.Last week, federal prosecutors called Portway's collection "chilling" and wrote in a sentencing recommendation that he should be imprisoned for at least 27 years, to protect the public."Portway has pled guilty to some of the most vile and heinous crimes known to our society," federal prosecutors wrote in court documents.Prosecutors could not be immediately reached for comment on Portway's sentencing Tuesday.
