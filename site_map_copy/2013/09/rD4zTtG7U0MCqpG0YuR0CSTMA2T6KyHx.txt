And late Wednesday night, the Navy secretary said he had ordered three reviews of security clearances, including one into the granting of Alexis' clearance.Here's a recap of the latest developments, meant to bring you up to speed quickly.Photos: Photos: Nation mourns Navy Yard victims Photos: Photos: Nation mourns Navy Yard victims Nation mourns Navy Yard shooting victims – A woman who said she works at the Washington Navy Yard looks at a memorial to the shooting victims on Wednesday, September 18.

He walked in, a law enforcement source said, with a bag slung in over his shoulder, passing through security with other employees arriving for work. While red flags come to light after the shooting, Navy officials say none of the details would have been enough to deny him clearance.Background check: Government contractor USIS said Thursday that it performed Alexis' 2007 background check for the Office of Personnel Management. USIS is the same firm that performed former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's background check for OPM that granted him a security clearance. The firm is under investigation.Disassembled shotgun: The bag Alexis was carrying apparently contained a disassembled Remington 870 shotgun, a law enforcement official said. Alexis is seen on surveillance video ducking into a bathroom and leaving with the shotgun.THE ATTACK30 minutes: Authorities believe Alexis came out of the bathroom and immediately began shooting at random, FBI Director James Comey said Thursday. Investigators believe he then went floor to floor shooting at workers, Comey said. Authorities and witnesses had previously said it appeared Alexis shot mostly from the building's atrium. According to law enforcement officials, he shot a guard on the first floor and took his handgun. It took more than 30 minutes for police to hunt down and kill Alexis, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department Chief Cathy Lanier said.Unexplained etchings: Alexis etched phrases into the shotgun, a source said. But investigators don't know what to make of it. They read: "Better off this way" and "My elf weapon."THE RESPONSEStand down: A government official told CNN that when the first radio call came in about a shooting at the Navy Yard, highly trained tactical U.S. Capitol Police officers headed to the base but were told by a watch commander to stand down. The chief has now ordered an "independent fact review." D.C. Police Chief Lanier told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday that she was not aware of anyone being turned away. "I don't think you could have had a faster response," she said.Undermanned: The Navy Yard also has its own police force. But there were only seven officers working Monday, a police officer and a union official said.THE SCENEBlood everywhere: Navy officials say damage inside Building 197 is so extensive, it may take weeks to repair and reopen it. "There is blood everywhere," one official said. "There is damage everywhere."JUST WATCHED Survivor: He's slaughtering with shotgun Replay More Videos ...

Two others -- a civilian and a police officer -- remain in fair condition. The officer, Scott Williams, is in "great spirits," said Chief Lanier. "I do think he's going to be OK, and recover fully, but he's still having some pretty serious complications," she said.THE MOTIVEStill a mystery: Investigators have talked to Alexis' friends and family. They've pored over his computers and other possessions. But, say law enforcement sources, nothing points to a specific motive for the rampage. "I'll reserve judgment on that until all of the work of the FBI is done," Lanier told CNN's Blitzer. "There's still a lot more to do."Hearing voices: In August, Alexis told police in Newport, Rhode Island, that he was hearing voices and was convinced that someone was using a "microwave machine" to send vibrations into his body to keep him awake. Police notified the Navy. The Navy isn't commenting.Strange behavior: Also in August, Alexis apparently had an altercation with a family at an airport in Virginia. He thought a woman was laughing at him and became angry. "He started getting a little belligerent, and started using profanity, and going off," said Glynda Boyd. Her brother approached someone to call security, which calmed him down. But Alexis left an unsettling impression. "It was weird. That never happened to us before like that. We had just come off a great vacation," said Michael Boyd.Trouble sleeping: That month, the VA Medical Center in Providence gave him medicine to help him sleep. A few days later, he went to a VA medical center in Washington to request a refill. Both times, he was asked if he was depressed or had suicidal or homicidal thoughts. He said he didn't. Also in August, CNN has learned Alexis traveled to a Buddhist temple in Massachusetts and asked the monks if he could spend the night. They suggested a hotel, according to temple spokesman Eang Tan, but Alexis reportedly said he didn't like to stay at hotels because there were noises there that bothered him.Disregarded warning: A senior Navy officer told CNN that Navy officials knew about Alexis' 2004 arrest for shooting out the tires of a car, but they decided to grant him security clearance anyway in 2007.THE MOTHER"So very sorry": Alexis' mother apologized Wednesday to the families of the victims, saying she didn't know "why he did what he did, and I'll never be able to ask him why." "Aaron is now in a place where he can no longer do harm to anyone, and for that I am glad," she said. "To the families of the victims, I am so, so very sorry that this has happened. My heart is broken."THE INQUIRYThorough review: On Wednesday night, the Navy secretary ordered three reviews:1) To see if Alexis' behavior on and off duty made him fit for duty or to hold security clearance.2) To see if a contractor is required to inform the Navy if it reviews an employee's clearance.3) A thorough look at how security clearances are granted and renewed in the Navy."Where there are gaps, we will close them. Where there are inadequacies, we will address them. And where there are failures, we will correct them," said Defense Secretary Hagel.
