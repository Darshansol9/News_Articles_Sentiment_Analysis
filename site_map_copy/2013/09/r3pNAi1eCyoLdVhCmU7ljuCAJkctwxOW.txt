An affirmative vote by the City Council next month is all that is needed now for construction to begin.Meanwhile, the wheel in Las Vegas is already well underway. Caesars Entertainment, the company that is building the wheel, tells CNN it will accept its first riders "early next year."Caesars declined to comment on the proposed New York Wheel.Rich Marin, the CEO of New York Wheel LLC, insists there's no bad blood."There's no competitiveness. Our markets are very different," he told CNN.When opened, both wheels would best Asia's "Singapore Flyer," which at 541 feet is the largest wheel in operation.However, even they may not retain the title for long. Marin tells CNN the designer of his wheel is working on an even bigger one in Dubai.
