Authorities already had recovered the body of a man who left the same car and tried to save the woman.One other death had been reported in Boulder County and one occurred in El Paso County.President Barack Obama declared an emergency for Boulder, Larimer and El Paso counties, FEMA announced Friday.

It felt great," Melinda Villa said of the National Guard's arrival at the Lyons apartment where she was stranded with her 1-month-old infant. She said, "I just felt like I was trapped. No phone, no water, barely any formula for my baby, barely any food for us."Jonathan Linenberger described a Noah's Ark-style evacuation as he, his fiancee and four dogs and three cats greeted the National Guard truck."We had to go (through) knee-deep water, at least. We had to wade our animals across into the truck to get them there," said Linenberger. "That was the first thing you can grab, your loved ones -- and that's what we have."The National Guard also was evacuating the entire population -- 285 people -- from the town of Jamestown by helicopter, CNN affiliate KCNC-TV reported.Four helicopters were being used for rescues in Boulder County Friday, Pelle said. The sheriff said helicopters also may have to be used indefinitely to deliver food and water to residents along damaged rural roads."Please know we're working hard," Pelle told residents who might see his televised news conference. "We're concerned about you. But you're going to have to be patient. Please know this is an unprecented event."About 80 people in Boulder County have been reported missing or "unaccounted for" by relatives, Sheriff's Cmdr.

He estimated 17 miles of Highway 34, a major artery, will need to be rebuilt.Lyons rescueThe National Guard effort to get residents out of Lyons began shortly after daybreak. About 100 troops in 21 heavy vehicles able to ford high waters streamed into the city to begin moving residents out, Gov. John Hickenlooper said.Residents had been entirely cut off, without water or sewer service, in many cases without electricity, facing what Fire Chief J.J. Hoffman said in a Facebook posting was a "very large disaster."It was unclear when the evacuation would be complete."I encourage all of you -- stay strong!" Hoffman wrote on the fire department's Facebook page. "We will make it through this, we are here for you and doing the absolute best we can with the resources we have to get to each and every one of you!"As Lyons evacuees arrived at a shelter set up in a church in nearby Longmont, they told stories of houses ripped off their foundations as the St. Vrain Creek turned into a violent river, CNN affiliate KMGH reported.KMGH reporter Theresa Marchetta said evacuees also described homes dangling off cliffs.Some people in Lyons still were awaiting rescue, evacuees said, and some residents had chosen to stay. Marchetta said evacuees told her there had been a town meeting and residents were checking on each other to ensure no one was missing.Danger elsewhereState transportation officials issued an emergency alert to residents in some of the hardest-hit counties, warning them to stay off roads because many are unstable and could give way without notice. They also closed Interstate 25 from the Wyoming line south to Denver. Part of Interstate 70 also was shut down.In Fort Collins, some residents had been urged to leave their homes.
