We embark on this season reflective of the circumstances that led to the band's suspension and are optimistic that this is a new day for the band and the university," Young said in a statement released this week.The university stressed in the statement that positive steps have been taken since Champion's death.It created an anti-hazing plan that includes a revised student code of conduct, a new anti-hazing website, scheduled campus training and beefed-up procedures for reporting and investigating hazing allegations.Champion, 26, was beaten on a bus after a November 2011 football game in Orlando as part of a band hazing ritual. He died "within an hour" of the beating, medical examiners reported.The Marching 100 was suspended shortly after his death.Both the university's president and band director resigned as a result of the investigation into Champion's death.
