And someone even claimed on YouTube that he captured footage of the streak of light.Matthew Isaacs, from Mission Viejo, said he was driving when he saw the flash of light."I saw this big, greenish flash like, light up the sky. It was headed pretty sideways from like, east to west. I thought, 'Is that a firework?' And then I realized, that couldn't be that big. It's just in the middle of nowhere in a totally dark area where there's no houses or anything where anyone would shoot fireworks. I thought, 'Man, it must have been a meteor,'" Isaacs told KCBS.The light most likely came from the South Taurids meteor showers.These meteors are generally the most visible in the first half of November, the American Meteor Society says.
