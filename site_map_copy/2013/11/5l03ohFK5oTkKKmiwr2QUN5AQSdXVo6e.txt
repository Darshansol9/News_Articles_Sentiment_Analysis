"We climbed out and got on top of the bus."The kids say they waited a couple of hours before being rescued."The water is very swift down there," Butler County Sheriff Kelly Herzet told CNN affiliate KWCH . "It took a little while to get everybody out. But everybody's safe, and it's a good day."Douglass School Superintendent Rob Reynolds also rushed to the accident site."When I arrived here at the scene, the kids were on top of the bus actually hugging each other," he said."The older kids were supporting the younger ones. ... I'm very proud of the kids."One of those older kids was sixth-grader Josh Barker. "Most of them were scared except me and my friend, and we just told them to calm down and stuff," he said.When it was all over, Logan was relieved. "I was happy to see my grandma. I guess this is one Halloween you'll never forget?"
