I throw a billion in the skies like Bruce Wayne."Shingles, who is in his 20s, and Kitchens are seeking monetary damages after the violation of their constitutional rights and suffering a "significant loss of privacy, humiliation, mental anguish, depression," the documents said."I felt like the old days, slavery.
