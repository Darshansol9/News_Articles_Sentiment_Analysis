Then we see a second high that comes in the fall," she said. "Is this late? It is rather late, because the temperatures have been very warm."A "very vigorous" low-pressure system is moving across the Great Lakes, she said."On the backside of that, temperatures are dramatically cooler. So that cold air is filtering in behind it, warm air out ahead of it," she said. "And...we get some twisting motion in the atmosphere. And that's why we see this tornadic activity."
