He will be extradited from Georgia back to Cocke County.The county sheriff's office told CNN affiliate WATE that the inmates escaped after a water leak occurred behind a stainless steel toilet attached to a wall. The bolts holding the unit in place had rusted out, and prior plumbing repairs had weakened the concrete. The inmates vandalized the toilet, yanked it from the wall and gained access to a hole which led outside of the facility.Photos from inside the cell where Cocke Co. inmates escaped.
