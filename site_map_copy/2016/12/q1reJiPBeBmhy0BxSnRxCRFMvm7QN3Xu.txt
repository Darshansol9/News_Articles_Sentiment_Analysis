This story has been updated to remove a section about a Muslim student in Ann Arbor, Michigan, who said she was threatened by a man with a lighter. In the weeks after the original report, Ann Arbor police investigated the matter and they announced December 21 that they have determined the incident never happened .(CNN) Fears of heightened bigotry and hate crimes have turned into reality for some Americans after Donald Trump's presidential win. And the list of incidents keeps growing.The Southern Poverty Law Center counted 867 cases of hateful harassment or intimidation in the United States in the 10 days after the November 8 election.The number of reported incidents declined almost every day from November 9 , the day after the election, to November 18. But the incidents have been widespread, the SPLC said."They've been everywhere -- in schools, in places of business like Walmart, on the street," SPLC President Richard Cohen said.Critics accused Trump of fostering xenophobia and Islamophobia during the divisive presidential campaign. Recent days have witnessed ugly episodes of racist or anti-Semitic, pro-Trump graffiti along with threats or attacks against Muslims.The President-elect said he was "so saddened" to hear about vitriol hurled by some of his supporters against minorities."If it helps, I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it," Trump told CBS' "60 Minutes."And two men in Connecticut were arrested over assault allegations against a Trump supporter. Not all incidents are spurred by Trump supporters. A man in Chicago reportedly was beaten as a bystander yelled, "You voted Trump!" And two men in Connecticut were arrested over assault allegations against a Trump supporter.The election-related incidents follow a year of heightened attacks against Muslim Americans. US Attorney General Loretta Lynch said FBI statistics for 2015 showed a 67% increase in hate crimes against Muslim Americans. Hate crimes against Jewish people, African Americans and LGBT individuals also increased.Overall, reported hate crimes spiked 6%, but the number could be higher because many incidents go unreported, Lynch said.Here's what some Americans are dealing with across the country:INTIMIDATION, VIOLENCE AFTER TRUMP WINMosques get letters calling for genocideA group calling itself "Americans for a Better Way" sent copies of a letter to at least five California mosques, calling Muslims "a vile and filthy people" and advocating genocide."There's a new sherriff [sic] in town -- President Donald Trump," reads the letter, which is addressed to "the Children of Satan.""He is going to cleanse America and make it shine again," it continues. "And, he's going to start with you muslims [sic]. He's going to do to you muslims [sic] what Hitler did to the jews [sic]. You muslims [sic] would be wise to pack your bags and get out of Dodge."The San Jose Police Department called the letter a "hate-motivated" incident and said it will investigate.'Go home' scrawled on carA Puerto Rican family's car was vandalized on November 17, with the words "Trump" and "Go home" scratched into the car in West Springfield, Massachusetts, according to police and one of the victims, who spoke to CNN.Jorge Santiago, an Army veteran who has served two deployments overseas, noticed scratches in the family's red sedan after he put his daughter on the bus to school, said his wife, Toni Santiago. He reported the vandalism to the West Springfield police soon afterward, she said.West Springfield Police Department Capt. Daniel Spaulding said detectives are following up and the investigation is ongoing. They have not determined whether it was a hate crime.The Santiagos are the only minority family on their street, Toni Santiago said. Their family supported Hillary Clinton during the election, but they didn't have any signs on their lawn, Santiago said. They have one small Clinton sticker on their other car parked in their driveway closer to the house, which was not vandalized, Santiago said."It is terrible. It is horrific, and still, in a way, I'm not surprised," Santiago said. "Racism was always there, but I feel now with our current President having been so vocal in some of the things he says, people feel more comfortable showing that racism, and our family was a target of it."Both Toni and Jorge are US citizens, Santiago said. Jorge was born in Puerto Rico and has lived in Massachusetts for many years, Santiago said. Toni grew up in Massachusetts and is a social worker in nearby Holyoke, Massachusetts, she said. They have three children, ages 2, 8 and 12. Toni posted a photo of the vandalism to Facebook and shared it with CNN."My first reaction is we need to get this out. We need to do something," Santiago said. "People think 'it's not going to happen in my town,' or Massachusetts is a liberal state, but this is real hate, and it's not OK."Uber driver verbally assaultedA motorist in a white SUV unleashed this hateful rant last week at an Uber driver in New York City.JUST WATCHED Lynch addresses increased hate crimes Replay More Videos ...
