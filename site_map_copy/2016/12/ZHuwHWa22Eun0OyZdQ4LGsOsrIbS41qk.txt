(CNN) Just one week before the fourth anniversary of the deadly school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, the father of one of the victims talked to CNN's Anderson Cooper about the hate he has received from people who believe the incident was a hoax."They don't think anything bad ever happens, they don't think anyone ever gets hurt," Len Pozner said on "AC360" Thursday. "They think whenever they see anything on the web or on television that is a crime or mass casualty event, that has to be a hoax."Pozner's 6-year-old son Noah was one of the 20 children and six adults killed by Adam Lanza in December 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The 20-year-old had killed his mother earlier in the day and then fatally shot himself as police arrived at the school.Pozner has received voice mails from what he called a "hoaxer," and has experienced other online hate as well. "They're pretty intense... I still remember the chills that were running down my body, hearing the voice mails. It's over the top."A Tampa woman was indicted Monday on four counts of making threats against Pozner .
