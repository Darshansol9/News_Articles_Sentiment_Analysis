Story highlights Police: An Ohio father said he shot and killed his son, 14, mistaking him for an intruderDad, 72, thought the boy had gone to school, authorities sayProsecutor: Forensic evidence matches father's account(CNN) Georta Mack's father thought the teen had gone to school Tuesday morning.
