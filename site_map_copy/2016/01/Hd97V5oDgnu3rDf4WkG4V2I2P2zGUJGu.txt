Story highlights Yosemite National Park renames some structuresPark in legal battle with former concessionaire DNCYAhwahnee Hotel to become The Majestic Yosemite Hotel(CNN) A few of the iconic structures and sites at Yosemite National Park are being renamed due to a legal battle over trademarks, the National Park Service said.In one move, The Ahwahnee Hotel, built in 1927 and a National Historic Landmark in the Yosemite Valley, will have its exotic-sounding name changed to The Majestic Yosemite Hotel, according to the National Park Service .
