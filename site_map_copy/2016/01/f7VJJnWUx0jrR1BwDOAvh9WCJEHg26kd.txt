(CNN) The Justice Department and officials from Ferguson, Missouri, have reached a tentative agreement on reforms in the police department and court system, according to a document released Wednesday by the city.The city posted the proposed consent decree on its website and asked for residents' input on the possible agreement. The deadline for comments is February 9, Ferguson officials said.Ferguson will also hold three public meetings in February."As in all negotiations, neither side received everything that they requested, and both sides made concessions in order to reach an agreement," Ferguson officials said . "This proposed agreement represents the best agreement that the city's representatives were able to obtain for the citizens of Ferguson."In March 2015, the Justice Department determined the Ferguson Police Department had demonstrated a "pattern and practice" of discrimination against African-Americans, targeting them disproportionately for traffic stops, use of force and jail sentences.The report said some Ferguson police officers saw residents as "sources of revenue," leading to practices that federal investigators said disproportionately targeted black residents.The 102-page report also found evidence of racist jokes sent by some Ferguson police officers and court officials.The Justice investigation came in the wake of the August 2014 shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson. Brown was black and Wilson is white.The department made 26 recommendations, including:-- Ferguson Police provide training to ensure officers aren't using bias in policing-- Officers practice community policing by getting out of cars, getting to know communities-- Focus police stops, searches and ticketing on protecting the public, as opposed to fundraising for the cityAlso in March, the Justice Department declined to bring civil rights charges against Wilson in the death of Brown, who was not armed. Brown's death prompted days of protests and riots in Ferguson and a national conversation about the role of race in police interactions with citizens.Justice Department investigators concluded Brown was moving toward the officer when Wilson fired. A grand jury also declined to indict Wilson, who left the force in November 2014Proposals in consent decreeThe city says in the consent decree that it will increase transparency, strengthen accountability in the police department and courts, and increase community confidence in the legal system.One step will focus on the racial bias prominently mentioned in the prior Justice Department report."The city agrees to provide clear policy, training and supervisory direction on prohibited conduct, including selective enforcement activities or decisions, or nonenforcement of the law, and the selection or rejection of particular tactics and strategies based upon stereotypes or bias," the document says.Consultants will be hired, if necessary, to develop policy or training, the city says.The document also outlines all aspects of policing, including when officers can stop people on the street for questioning.Ferguson also will form a citizen's Neighborhood Police Steering Committee, designed to provide input on law enforcement issues. It will be separate from the Civilian Review Board, the consent decree says. The police department will form a Force Review Board that will examine some incidents in which an officer uses force.The city said it will sponsor a series of small meetings between officers and people who live in communities that have a poor relationship with the department. Every police officer will have to attend at least one series of meetings.As part of the proposal, Ferguson promises that every police officer will use body or dash cameras and be trained within 180 days of an agreement.The department didn't get body cameras until weeks after Brown was killed and then it was only a few recorders.A year later it ordered more.In a move to increase personal engagement between officers and residents, cops will have beats. The department will assign officers to specific neighborhoods for a minimum of one year. Cops will occasionally patrol their beats on foot or by bicycle.The proposal also addresses the legal system as a revenue generator."The city agrees not to use municipal arrest warrants as a means of collecting civil court debt," it says.Ferguson also has 60 days after an agreement is signed to revise its online payment system to allow late payments and payment plans.Independent monitorThe Justice Department and city officials will choose a panel of people to act as a monitoring group. Every six months the monitor will file reports giving updates on the city's progress. Those reports may include information gathered from unannounced visits to the police department or city facilities.The agreement ends when Ferguson meets its obligations for two consecutive years.
