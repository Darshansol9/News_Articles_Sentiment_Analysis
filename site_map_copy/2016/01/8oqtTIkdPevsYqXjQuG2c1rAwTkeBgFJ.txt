(CNN) Maybe it wasn't an H-bomb... Maybe Ted Cruz can't be President... And maybe your Wall Street friends are gonna have a really bad day. It's Thursday, and here are the five things you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door .NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR BOMB TESTNorth Korea bragged to anyone who'd listen yesterday about the success of its nuclear bomb test. But was it a hydrogen bomb? The White House isn't buying it , and Norsar, a group that monitors nuclear tests, said the blast was too small to have come from a hydrogen bomb. We'll probably never know for sure, since North Korea continues to play the role of the world's biggest recluse.CAMPAIGN 2016Ted Cruz birtherism is officially a thing now, after Donald Trump said he wasn't sure Cruz -- who was born in Canada to an American mom -- was even eligible to be president. And John McCain of all people agrees with Trump, saying it's "worth looking into." Remember, McCain faced his own birther questions during his 2008 run because he was born in Panama (but on a U.S. military base). Another reason why McCain is jumping into the fray: he pretty much hates Cruz's guts.OBAMACAREThis time will be different: That's what the GOP says after Congress passed That's what the GOP says after Congress passed Obamacare repeal legislation that will finally get to the President's desk -- where it will go down in flames. President Obama has vowed a veto, and the GOP doesn't have enough votes to override it. So why even do it at all?

Think that point's already been made after 60+ votes to repeal the law.JUST WATCHED House to send Obamacare repeal bill to Obama Replay More Videos ...

Once again things started off badly this morning in China, where stock trading was halted just 30 minutes after markets there took a 5% dive. Over here, the Dow dropped 252 points yesterday, as Wall Street tried to absorb not only the Chinese turmoil, but also North Korea's alleged nuke test along with the latest belly flop in oil prices.
