(CNN) Three of four life rafts believed to be aboard two military helicopters that collided off Hawaii have been retrieved, the U.S. Coast Guard said Monday in a press release.The fourth raft was spotted and is expected to be removed later Monday.Rescuers have expanded their search for 12 Marines missing since their two military helicopters apparently crashed into each other Thursday over the waters off Oahu.After four days of searching, "There is no indication from the sightings that any survivors have been aboard any of the life rafts," the release said.A Navy ship equipped with sonar arrived Sunday and conducted an underwater search. No debris was sighted, the Coast Guard said.Responders have conducted 89 searches and covered 21,000 square nautical miles (or 24,150 square miles), the Coast Guard said. The searches are layered on top of each other to provide multiple perspectives and fresh eyes on the scene."Our focus is to locate these Marines and know with absolute certainty we've thoroughly canvassed every location we might find them," said Lt. Scott Carr, Coast Guard 14th District public affairs officer.The Coast Guard asked people along the coast to alert the Marines if they find any debris. The area is a popular surfing destination and surfers were told to avoid any debris in the water.A Marine Corps CH-53E Super StallionCoast Guard Capt. James Jenkins said some debris has been collected, consistent with the types of aircraft missing, but that it's still coming in, and that he couldn't comment further.Apparent collisionThe two CH-53 copters appear to have gone down during a training flight off the Hawaii island of Oahu late Thursday, authorities said. No mayday call was received, just word that something had gone wrong, said Carr said.A civilian on the beach first told authorities of seeing a fireball, followed by a second person reporting a flare.Searchers spotted a fire and debris field, including an empty life raft, about 2Â½ miles north of Haleiwa Beach and later floating pieces of debris consistent with military aircraft.Six people were on board each of the heavy-lift transport helicopters.Corps names MarinesThe Marine Corps has named the 12 missing men.
