As we read through today's newsletter, we couldn't help but notice just how much sad news there is. Let's hope the rest of the week is a little brighter. Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door .1. New York-New Jersey bombings2. Minnesota stabbingsThose who knew him described Dahir Adan as an "exceptional student" who went to a mall in St. Cloud to buy the latest iPhone. The rest of us know him as the man who stabbed 10 people there. Authorities will try to reconcile those two radically different portraits as the investigation into the stabbings continue. Let's not forget about the hero in all of this: part-time officer Jason Falconer , who shot and killed Adan during the attack.3. Tulsa shootingA black man is killed by police. Video of the incident is released. Protesters chant "hands up, don't shoot." State and federal authorities investigate. That all-too-familiar script is playing out in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where 40-year-old Terence Crutcher was fatally shot after his car broke down . Video of the incident shows he had his hands up; police admit he was unarmed.4. Syria civil warThe whole point of the ceasefire was to get life-saving aid to a quarter of a million people in Aleppo. But even that seems impossible in this wretched war. An aid convoy was attacked in a rebel-held area outside the city, destroying 18 of the 31 trucks and killing at least 20. A warehouse was also hit too. And of course no one's taken responsibility.5. BridgegateDid New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie know about "Bridgegate" while it was going on? Feds say he did and that they'll prove it during the trial of two Christie confidantes. One of the confidantes will testify he told Christie the lane closures were causing traffic problems in Fort Lee, whose mayor was a Christie rival. This is important because Christie has long denied any involvement. Here's a very helpful explainer from Max Blau.BREAKFAST BROWSEPeople are talking about these. Read up.
