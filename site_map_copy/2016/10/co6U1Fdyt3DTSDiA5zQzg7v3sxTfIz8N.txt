(CNN) A year ago this month, Hurricane Joaquin slammed into El Faro, sinking the cargo ship and killing all 33 people aboard.Its replacement, Isla Bella, could travel the same route this week despite the looming Hurricane Matthew -- if its captain does not foresee any risks.Tote Marine, which operates the Isla Bella, said it's up to the captain to decide whether the ship will depart for its three-day trip from Puerto Rico to Jacksonville, Florida.Company: We trust our captainsBy late Tuesday, Tote Marine had not announced any change in Isla Bella's schedule as a result of the massive storm. It said captains are at liberty to change course for reasons such as weather, crew illness or to help another ship at sea."Our crews are trained to deal with unfolding weather situations and are prepared to respond to emerging situations while at sea," Tote Marine spokesman Mike Hanson said in a statement.Hanson said they have "great confidence" that their officers will adjust their sailing schedules accordingly.He could not say when a decision on the ship's schedule might be made.When El Faro sailed into a storm and capsized last year, Tote Marine expressed the same view, saying it trusts its captains to make the right decision.El Faro's sinkingJUST WATCHED El Faro owners try to block families from suing Replay More Videos ...
