They dealt with Hurricane Floyd's devastation in 1999.Myrna Deloatch escaped from her house in Tarboro with clothes, one car and three German shepherds, plus some pictures.

Facing the possibility of more flooding, he temporarily relocated to Grifton.After Hurricane Floyd in 1999, Reed said, his mother had to be rescued by boat from the top floor of the family home after it took on 6 feet of water. His grandparents, who owned the house then, put on a new roof and raised the house a few feet after that storm.Dail Reed's house faces the threat of more flooding Tuesday in Snow Hill, North Carolina.Before Matthew moved through, Reed said, his family moved as many things as they could to the second floor, including heirlooms."This house has a lot of flood stories," he said.About two years ago, Reed said, frozen water pipes broke during a cold winter, flooding the house and causing $90,000 in damage. The family had just completed repairs when Matthew struck.Reed says 2 feet of water has flooded his family's house in Snow Hill.The family had recently dropped their flooding insurance for the first time."We've had all sorts of storms before and never had any problems," he said.Reed said his family can probably live upstairs and start work on repairs as long as the water doesn't move above the first floor. If not, he will "buy the camper I always wanted" and live in it until his house can be restored.In Goldsboro, the threat of flooding forced authorities to evacuate 797 inmates from the Neuse Correctional Institution to other prisons. The minimum-security facility for male inmates is near where the Little and Neuse rivers meet.'Get out now'McCrory raised concerns about communities below Woodlake Dam in Moore County.
