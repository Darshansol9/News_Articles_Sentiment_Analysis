At least 127 were arrested on various charges, including reckless endangerment, criminal trespass, engaging in a riot, assault on a peace officer and resisting arrest.The activists, who call themselves "water protectors," said they were staging a peaceful procession in honor of sacred sites already destroyed in construction. They accused law enforcement of spraying them with Mace and throwing people to the ground "without provocation" as they attempted to leave, according to a joint statement from three groups.The demonstrations continued Sunday as activists set up road blocks on Highway 1806, leading to its closure for several hours. Organizers said they were taking back land based on treaty rights for a camp. The highway later reopened after protesters removed a blockade, officials said.Amid the activity, law enforcement shot at a drone camera activists were using to document police encounters, the group said. Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier confirmed the incident, saying the drone endangered a law enforcement helicopter flying over the area.Read More
