Story highlights Coach reportedly tells ESPN that he kicked a player off the teamAlleged victim and perpetrators are high school football players(CNN) Allegations that white students threw a noose around a black student's neck and "pulled the noose tight" have rocked a southern Mississippi high school.Members of the Mississippi chapter of the NAACP claim that some members of the Stone High School football team in Wiggins put the noose on the black student earlier this month at the high school football field house. The alleged victim and perpetrators are football players.The NAACP wants a federal investigation of the incident, saying the students in the alleged attack haven't been expelled, school officials didn't report it to law enforcement nor have they told the victim's parents what kind of disciplinary action would be taken."They failed to protect this student throughout this ordeal," the organization said in a statement.
