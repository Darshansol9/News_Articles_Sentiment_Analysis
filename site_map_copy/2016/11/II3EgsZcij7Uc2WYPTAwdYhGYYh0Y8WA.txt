Story highlights Jorge Elorza is the mayor of Providence, Rhode IslandElorza said that undocumented immigrants would be protected in his city(CNN) Jorge Elorza, the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, vowed to protect undocumented immigrants in his city on Wednesday, becoming the latest in a series of mayors across the country who have said they would defy President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promise to aggressively deport illegal immigrants.Elorza told CNN's Carol Costello that, regardless of any new policies, his city will "stand up for our undocumented immigrant families.""People in the community, they are concerned and they are scared because of what they heard from Donald Trump during the campaign.
