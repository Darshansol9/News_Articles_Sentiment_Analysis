Why did the bus crash? What, if anything, affected the driver? What could have prevented the crash?Investigators say they have a great deal of evidence to compile and process, including videos and interviews with the children and other witnesses. Investigators are reviewing videos from the three cameras on the bus -- one rear-facing, one forward-facing and one facing the entrance -- and an informational box on the bus to determine what caused the crash.Hart said investigators were looking into why the bus was not on its designated route at the time of the crash.The driverWhat we know: Johnthony Walker, 24, has been charged with five counts of vehicular homicide, reckless endangerment and reckless driving. He could face more charges as the investigation unfolds.Bus driver Johnthony Walker has been charged with vehicular homicide."Mr. Walker lost control of the bus and swerved off of the roadway to the right, striking an elevated driveway and mailbox, swerved to the left and began to overturn, striking a telephone pole and a tree," according to the arrest affidavit.No traces of alcohol or drugs were found in Walker's blood, lead police investigator Sgt. Austin Garrett.After the accident, Walker called his mother, Gwenevere Cook. She said her son tried to get the children off the bus.

The driver in the other vehicle, in an interview with the Chattanooga Times Free Press , alleged that the school bus went through a stop sign and scraped her car.Also in 2013, Walker was cited for failure to show proof of insurance. His driver's license was suspended for three weeks. It was reinstated in late March 2014, according to state records.What we don't know: What kind of vetting and training did Walker go through to become a school bus driver?

It was later upgraded to "satisfactory" after the unspecified problems were resolved, Hart said. A website lists the most recent satisfactory rating date as July 31, 2015."We will be exploring what were the deficiencies," Hart said."Our entire team at Durham School Services is devastated by the accident yesterday that tragically claimed the lives of Chattanooga students," the company said in a statementDurham CEO David Duke said in a YouTube statement that the company, which runs the bus service, was cooperating with the federal and local investigations."My responsibility now is to look for answers -- answers about why this tragedy occurred and answers for how we can make sure that this never, ever happens again," he said.Duke said he could not comment further."I don't want to compromise that investigation," he said. "What I can do is promise that I'm determined, that we're determined to find out what happened. And that we will offer any support that we can to the families."What we don't know: Was there proper oversight?
