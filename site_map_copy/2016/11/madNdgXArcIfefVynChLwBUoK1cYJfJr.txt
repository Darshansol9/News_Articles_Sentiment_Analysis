While at work, Fiesel became aware of a "pungent odor," but wasn't able to figure out where it was coming from, according to court documents. She then noticed what felt like a string brushing against her leg. When she reached down to inspect, she found something else entirely."To her utter shock and disbelief, as she ran her hand over the hem of the dress, she felt an unusual bulge and suddenly realized that it was not a string that was rubbing against her leg, but was instead a leg rubbing against her leg," the court documents state. "The leg of a dead rodent, that is."Fiesel, represented by Morelli Law Firm PLLC, says she has suffered "significant personal injuries and emotional distress," according to court documents. She also says she developed a rash that was later diagnosed as a rodent-borne disease, according to court documents.
