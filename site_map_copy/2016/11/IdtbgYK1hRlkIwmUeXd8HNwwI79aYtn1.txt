Near Cannon Ball, North Dakota (CNN) The frigid North Dakota cold hasn't stopped thousands of protesters from camping outside, trying to halt construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline.And they're about to get a boost from hundreds of veterans.Gov. Jack Dalrymple had ordered the protesters to leave immediately, citing the harsh wintry conditions . But those freezing at the campsite lambasted the governor's claim that he's trying to protect safety. ll"If you want to make this safer, then stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. Stop the whole thing completely," said Wicahpi Ksapa, a tribal headsman for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. "You want to poison our people?"JUST WATCHED Pipeline protester: 'It will be a battle' Replay More Videos ...

Only when protesters have broken the law have they been arrested or asked to disperse."What's next ?The US Army Corps of Engineers warned last week that come Monday, activists who refuse to leave could be arrested.JUST WATCHED Police remove pipeline protesters Replay More Videos ...

Dalrymple ordered protesters to clear out immediately, citing a reason other than trespassing: harsh winter conditions.He said the protesters' temporary dwellings have yet to be inspected and approved, and failure to do so posed serious public safety concerns.The governor also said first responders would no longer be responsible for providing emergency services to those who remained.Morton County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Maxine Herr said authorities will "passively" enforce the governor's order for protesters to vacate the area.She also said law enforcement would immediately start blocking people and supplies from entering the protest campsite. She later amended that statement to say that anyone who enters the area does so at their own risk and will be subject to penalties.In other words, there will not be a road block, but anyone entering the area will be notified that they are trespassing and penalized accordingly.Native Americans reminded of past treatmentStanding Rock Sioux Tribe member Chase Iron Eyes, the initial threats of arrest have brought back memories of the government's past treatment of Native Americans."You have a government agency trying to declare us trespassers on our own treaty land and threatening to penalize us, criminally charge us and possibly forcibly round us up if we don't return to the reservation," he said.The pipeline was originally slated to lie north of Bismarck, North Dakota, in an area that did not cross Native American reservations. The current proposed route, however, would take it through four states, stretching 1,172 miles to connect areas with oil in North Dakota to southern Illinois.It would cut through the Sioux Tribe's reservation, and the tribe says it could potentially destroy sacred lands and prevent access to clean drinking water.Accusations of violence from both sidesJUST WATCHED Police clash with Dakota pipeline protesters Replay More Videos ...
