John Henderson of the Corps said in a letter to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe leader.On Sunday, the Corps issued a new statement saying it wants a "peaceful and orderly transition to a safer location, and has no plans for forcible removal."But, those who choose to stay "do so at their own risk as emergency, fire, medical, and law enforcement response cannot be adequately provided in these areas," the statement added. "Those who remain will be considered unauthorized and may be subject to citation under federal, state or local laws."JUST WATCHED Police clash with Dakota pipeline protesters Replay More Videos ...
