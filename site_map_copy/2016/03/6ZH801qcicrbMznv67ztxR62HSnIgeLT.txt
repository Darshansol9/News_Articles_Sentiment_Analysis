(CNN) Yellowstone grizzly bears are emerging from their winter hibernation to news that wildlife officials no longer consider them threatened."Stable population numbers for grizzlies for more than a decade also indicate that the Yellowstone ecosystem is at or near its carrying capacity for the bears," it said.Hottle also loves visiting Glacier National Park in Montana, a nine-hour drive by car. "There's a wildness about Glacier that makes it even more dangerous and adventurous than Yellowstone," he said. Glacier's Wild Goose Island is shown here.Glacier National Park – Hottle also loves visiting Glacier National Park in Montana, a nine-hour drive by car.

He and his family have hiked "every inch" of Electric Peak, a nearly 11,000-foot mountain.Yellowstone: Our first national park – Hottle recommends that hikers travel in groups of at least three, stay on designated trails, carry bear pepper spray and make noise as they hike to avoid surprising bears (mother bears can attack when surprised).

Shown here is a harem of 27 cows resting in Mammoth Hot Springs near the town post office. Visitors are cautioned to stay at least 25 yards away from the elk, which have been known to ram cars and trap people.Yellowstone: Our first national park – In elk mating season, which starts around September, the bulls come down from the mountains and gather up as many cows (female elk) as they can into harems.

Travelers have been known to stop their cars in the middle of the road to look at the view, or worse: look sideways to admire the nature while driving.Yellowstone: Our first national park – Rangers plead with with visitors to pull off the road to shoot pictures of bison (shown here in the Lamar Valley) or other wildlife that call Yellowstone home.

He likes to stop at a pullout about halfway to the valley and hike into the woods, where he can sometimes see a wolf or its pack.

When the light is right, hike up one of the mountains surrounding the spring and you'll see the steam change colors because of the spring's bacteria.Yellowstone: Our first national park – Grand Prismatic Spring is Hottle's favorite spring in the park, and it's in Midway Geyser Basin about five miles from Old Faithful.

They could be hunted within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which lies in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana , though not the Yellowstone National Park itself.Conservation plansThe wildlife service said the restoration of bear populations in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho "stands as one of America's great conservation successes.""Our proposal today underscores and celebrates more than 30 years of collaboration with our trusted federal, state and tribal partners to address the unique habitat challenges of grizzlies," director Dan Ashe said."The final post-delisting management plans by these partners will ensure healthy grizzly populations persist across the Yellowstone ecosystem long into the future."Public chance to commentThe wildlife service is seeking comment from the public, agencies and scientists after publication in the Federal Register, expected in the next few days."Even with this proposed delisting, the service remains committed to the conservation of the Yellowstone grizzly bear, and will stay engaged to ensure that this incredible species remains recovered," Ashe said.Still in need of protection?"Yellowstone grizzly bears are an isolated population that is experiencing high levels of conflicts with people and is likely declining in the wake of the loss of whitebark pine, a critically important food source," said Sylvia Fallon , a senior scientist at NRDC.Fallon questioned the accuracy of the population estimates, saying the bears were on the decline.She added they would likely also need to be connected to bears outside the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem to avoid genetic problems."The Endangered Species Act has been tremendously successful at saving this population and preventing its demise," she said." And retaining those valuable protections until the Yellowstone grizzly population is more robust and its future more certain is the best way to turn that past success into true recovery."The Fish and Wildlife Service removed the Yellowstone grizzly bear population from the threatened species list in 2007, but the decision was challenged and later overturned by a federal district judge. A later appeal by the service failed.The wildlife service describes endangered species a s those at the brink of extinction now while a threatened species "are likely to be at the brink in the near future."Awake and hungryMeanwhile, Yellowstone National Park has warned that its grizzlies are awake, hungry and looking for food.The National Parks Service said the first confirmed report of grizzly bear activity after the winter hibernation came nearly two weeks ago.1st grizzly sighting of the spring today over Nez Perce Crk.
