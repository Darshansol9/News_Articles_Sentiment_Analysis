Story highlights An extreme tilt drives big changes in atmospheric pressure, researchers saySometimes, those changes allow liquid nitrogen to flow on the dwarf planet(CNN) Pluto's exaggerated and wildly varying tilt may have helped give the dwarf planet rivers and lakes of liquid nitrogen and an atmosphere that, at times, has exceeded that of Mars, according to scientists studying the trove of data streaming back from the New Horizons probe.While Earth's seasons are the product of its 23-degree tilt, Pluto is tilted at an angle of 120 degrees and wobbles back and forth by about 20 degrees over millions of years. So, at times, much of the planet in a "tropical" zone that, despite the term, is hardly balmy.At other times, Pluto's arctic zones can extend nearly to its equator.The overall average surface temperature is about minus-400 degrees Fahrenheit.The radical variations can, at times, drive changes in Pluto's atmosphere that could allow for flowing liquid nitrogen on the surface, explaining features that look very much like stream beds and frozen lakes, principal mission investigator Alan Stern said Monday at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston.Read More
