Carruthers survived.Dalton then killed Richard Smith, 53, and his son Tyler, 17, at a car dealership, police said.Police said Dalton committed the last shooting in the parking lot of a Cracker Barrel restaurant, killing Dorothy Brown, 74; Barbara Hawthorne, 68; Mary Lou Nye, 62; and Mary Jo Nye, 60.Abigail Kopf, a 14-year-old girl who was in the passenger seat of one of the women's vehicles, also was struck but survived and was in fair condition at a hospital earlier this week, according to a Go Fund Me page set up by a family friend.Doctors initially thought Abigail would not survive, and she initially was kept on life support so her organs could be donated. But her condition rebounded after her mother reported that, while she was holding Abigail's hand, Abigail suddenly squeezed back.Two hours after the final shooting, police arrested Dalton without incident in downtown Kalamazoo and also seized a weapon from his car, authorities said.Uber passenger: Dalton drove erratically before shootingOne of Dalton's Uber passengers on the day of the shootings -- but before the bloodshed started -- told CNN that Dalton started behaving erratically after receiving a phone call in the car.Dalton received the call roughly a mile into the trip, Matt Mellen told CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360Â°." Mellen heard Dalton tell the caller that he had a rider at the moment and would call back after dropping the passenger off.Dalton hung up and then started driving erratically, Mellen said.Dalton ran red lights, squealed the tires and nearly sideswiped another vehicle, Mellen said.Mellen pleaded for the driver to stop and let him get out, but he initially refused. Once Dalton slammed on the brakes, Mellen jumped out of the car and called police, he said.
