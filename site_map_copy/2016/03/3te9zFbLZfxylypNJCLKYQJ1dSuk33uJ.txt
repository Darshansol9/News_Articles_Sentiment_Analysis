Photos: Endangered no more: Animal species on the rebound Here's a look at other rare animals whose once-dwindling populations have rebounded. The inspiration for the teddy bear, the Louisiana black bear, will be delisted as a threatened species on March 11, 2015. The bear was originally listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1992 due to habitat loss. Hide Caption 1 of 15Photos: Endangered no more: Animal species on the rebound Citing significant improvements in its population and habitat conditions and reductions in direct threats,the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed downlisting the West Indian manatee from "endangered" to "threatened" under the Endangered Species Act. Hide Caption 2 of 15Photos: Endangered no more: Animal species on the rebound Thanks to conservation efforts by states, landowners and others, the Delmarva Peninsula fox squirrel -- native to Mid-Atlantic states -- is no longer at risk of extinction. One of the animals included on the first list of endangered species nearly a half-century ago, the squirrel was set to be removed from the list in December 2015, the U.S. Department of the Interior said.

The Pacific gray whales have been protected since 1970 and are at the center of a growing whale-watching industry. They were removed from the endangered species list in 1994, although climate change has impacted their food chain and caused their numbers to decline again in recent years.

Hide Caption 7 of 15Photos: Endangered no more: Animal species on the rebound The Virginia northern flying squirrel was in danger of extinction in 1985, when scientists documented only 10 remaining animals. But its population made a comeback, and the squirrel was removed from the list in 2013. The squirrel is native to West Virginia and, yes, Virginia. It doesn't really fly, although membranes between its legs serve as "wings" and let it glide from tree to tree.

Hide Caption 9 of 15Photos: Endangered no more: Animal species on the rebound The gray wolf, which can be found in wilderness areas of the northern American West and Canada, was listed as endangered in 1978.

According to a list released by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, it was added in 1974 and delisted in 1995. Hide Caption 11 of 15Photos: Endangered no more: Animal species on the rebound The American peregrine falcon was classified as endangered in 1970 after its population was decimated by pesticides. By 1975, there were only 324 known nesting pairs of American peregrine falcons. Conservation efforts helped them rebound, and they were removed from the list in 1999. There are now more than 2,000 known breeding pairs of the birds in North America.

Hide Caption 13 of 15Photos: Endangered no more: Animal species on the rebound The bald eagle, a revered American national symbol, was famously endangered for 40 years. By 1963, only 417 known nesting pairs of bald eagles remained in the U.S. Vigorous conservation efforts revived the handsome bird, and it was removed from the list in 2007. Today there are more than 10,000 nesting pairs of bald eagles in the contiguous United States. Hide Caption 14 of 15
