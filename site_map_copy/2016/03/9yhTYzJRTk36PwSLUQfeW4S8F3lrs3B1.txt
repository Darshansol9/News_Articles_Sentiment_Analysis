Story highlights A federal appeals court judge says Tom Brady's explanation for destroying his cell phone makes no senseThe NFL is appealing a lower court ruling that struck down its suspension of the New England Patriots' superstar quarterbackThe NFL believes Brady schemed with Patriots clubhouse staff members to deflate footballs before the 2015 AFC Championship(CNN) Could the destruction of Tom Brady's cellphone turn the tide in the Deflategate case back in the NFL's favor?Brady's attorney was grilled by judges Thursday in the NFL's appeal to reinstate a four-game suspension on the New England Patriots' superstar quarterback. A large part of the focus was on that phone, which the NFL believed may have held evidence of a scheme to deflate footballs used in the AFC Championship Game in January 2015.The case is in the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in New York. A ruling isn't expected for months. Neither Brady nor NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell were present in the proceedings Thursday.In May 2015, the NFL imposed the suspension on Brady after an independent investigator found it "more probable than not" that Brady was involved with locker room attendant Jim McNally and equipment assistant John Jastremski in a scheme to take air out of the footballs New England would use in the game.The presumed advantage of an underinflated football is that it is easier to catch.
