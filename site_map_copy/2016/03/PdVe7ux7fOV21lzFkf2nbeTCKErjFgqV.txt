Story highlights Johnny Manziel thanks Browns for opportunity to play for themThe 2012 Heisman Trophy winner faces legal trouble in TexasManziel is now a free agent, and any team can sign him(CNN) Johnny Football's time in Cleveland is over.The Cleveland Browns announced Friday, two days after the start of the 2016 NFL calendar year, that the team has released the troubled Johnny Manziel, making the quarterback a free agent and available to sign with any team. The big question is whether any team wants him."I'd like to thank the Browns for the opportunity they gave me nearly two years ago. We all hoped that we were building what could be a championship team for Cleveland," Manziel said through a publicist. "I will always remember the support I received from the organization, my teammates and especially the fans."Manziel, whom the Browns traded up to select 22nd overall in the 2014 NFL draft, was signed with the team through 2017. His two years in the NFL have been nothing short of turbulent, and his latest legal situation may be the final straw.In the most recent accusation, Manziel's former girlfriend Colleen Crowley said in an affidavit that the NFL quarterback restrained, hit and threatened her on January 30. She accused Manziel of grabbing her by the hair and hitting her ear, causing her to lose her hearing.
