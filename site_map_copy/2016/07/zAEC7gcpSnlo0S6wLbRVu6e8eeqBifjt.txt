(CNN) Shortly after he gunned down five officers in Dallas, Micah Xavier Johnson sang and laughed at police. He threatened more deaths with explosives. And he left a final, cryptic message: the letters "RB," scribbled twice on a wall with his own blood.Were these acts inspired solely by the misplaced angst of a deranged gunman? Or was he radicalized by online groups calling for violence against police?Here's the latest on the investigation into the deadliest day for U.S. police since 9/11:The carnage could have been much worseDuring his hourslong standoff with police, Johnson said he was ready to kill more cops with bombs, Dallas police Chief David Brown told CNN."We had negotiated with him for about two hours, and he just basically lied to us -- playing games, laughing at us, singing, asking how many (police officers) did he get and that he wanted to kill some more and that there were bombs there," Brown said.A search of the gunman's home revealed he had plenty of supplies to make explosives. Brown said police found bomb-making materials and a journal that suggested Johnson had been practicing detonations and appeared ready to take aim at larger targets.It was enough, Brown said, to have "devastating effects on our city."He 'liked' a group that called for violence against policeJUST WATCHED Black hate groups and online radicalization Replay More Videos ...

He also had visited the websites of the Nation of Islam and the Black Riders Liberation Party -- which the Southern Poverty Law Center considers to be hate groups.Tom Fuentes, a former associate director with the FBI, said the messages and the groups behind them should be treated the same way the federal government investigates ISIS."It's no different than the ISIS propaganda that goes out," Fuentes said. "And the question for law enforcement is, where do you draw the line between free speech and something else? If a message is espousing someone to take action, even if they inspire one guy to strike out, isn't that enough?"Hundreds of statements, mountains of footageJUST WATCHED Dallas gunman wrote 'RB' in his own blood Replay More Videos ...
