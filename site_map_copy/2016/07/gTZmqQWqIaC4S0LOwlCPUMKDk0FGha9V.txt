Residents turned out en masse a week afterward. There was a formal ceremony at the Cathedral Church of St. Luke, where the bell tolled once for each victim, and at an impromptu vigil at nearby Lake Eola Park, attended by an estimated 50,000 people.The mass gathering culminated a week of vigils around the world.JUST WATCHED Global vigils held for Orlando shooting victims Replay More Videos ...

"And I think it has to be public for the rest of the community to stand up and say, 'We're not OK with it, and we're going to get behind them and provide them with the support and strength they need. We love them so we will conquer that hate with love.' "JUST WATCHED Tens of thousands 'transcend hate' in Orlando Replay More Videos ...

The history center also will preserve some of the other tributes left at makeshift memorials around the city -- letters, notes, signs and other tokens -- for the 49 killed and the approximately 50 injured during the attack.The city of Orlando has announced other plans to ensure the dead aren't forgotten.It plans a paver garden as a permanent memorial. The names of the victims will be on stones placed around Lake Beauty Park outside the Orlando Regional Medical Center where the crosses had been placed.Nine victims died at the hospital, where 28 operations were preformed on victims in the first 24 hours after the attack and 71 surgeries related to the attack have been performed to date, hospital CEO David Strong said.Four victims remain hospitalized, Strong said.The exact nature of the future county memorial is not determined, said Orange County Regional History Center Director Michael Perkins. But the power of the crosses, which Zanis had placed outside the medical center after driving them 1,200 miles from Aurora, Illinois, was indisputable, at least for many people, and especially for one mother.Mayra Alvear, whose daughter Amanda was killed in the attack, was overwhelmed by emotion as she watched the crosses gathered Tuesday and helped pick up her daughter's cross and load it into the truck.For her, the crosses' new home exemplified a beloved community."Everything was done with respect and honor," she said. "Love wins. Love, no hate."
