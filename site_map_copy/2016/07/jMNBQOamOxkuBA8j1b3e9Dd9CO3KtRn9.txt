(CNN) The FBI has found 14 personal electronic devices from those aboard the balloon that crashed Saturday in Texas, NTSB spokesman Robert Sumwalt said. They include cell phones, one iPad, and three cameras. The cameras, he said, are destroyed, but he said he hopes NTSB lab technicians can recover the images.
