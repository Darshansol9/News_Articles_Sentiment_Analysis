MUST WATCH From Hooters waitress to the boardroom 05:59(CNN) Strange bedfellows indeed. Organizers of a Colorado Cub Scout camp were bombarded with questions -- and more than a little rage -- when parents found out the event was sponsored in part by a local Hooters. And it wasn't just the sweet, sweet wing money they were contributing. A few Hooters girls even showed up in company gear to volunteer at the Denver event.It's not exactly a perfect marriage of interests, and some parents told CNN affiliate KMGH they were shocked to find the camp they were paying for had involved the famous breasts 'n' thighs joint. Some even said they found pictures of their boys online, posing with the Hooters girls who had worked the camp.Michelle Kettleborough was one of the moms who found the arrangement odd, and she told KMGH she spied the telltale orange regalia as she was picking up her son last week."I take a look and I'm like, 'Are they wearing Hooters visors? Wait a minute."A picture on Hooters Colorado's Facebook page shows Hooters girls working with the Scouts.Kettleborough said she later found pictures of her son on the Hooters Colorado Facebook page. As of Wednesday a few remain, showing girls in Hooters-branded gear posing with young boys and adults at a "Take Flight" Cub Scout camp event.
