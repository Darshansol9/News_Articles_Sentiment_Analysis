I'm scared for my life."The valet didn't know what to do and allowed the pair to leave, according to the affidavit.Manziel denies violenceCrowley and Manziel then drove to Crowley's car. They both got in -- against her will, Crowley says -- but she jumped out and hid behind bushes."He grabbed me by my hair and threw me back into the car and got back in himself. He hit me with his open hand on my left ear for jumping out of the car. I realized immediately that I could not hear out of that ear, and I still cannot today, two days later," the affidavit reads.Still afraid for her life, Crowley says she hit Manziel several times.They then left Dallas for her apartment in Fort Worth.

The woman claimed Manziel hit her several times to prevent her from getting out of the vehicle, while downplaying the incident."I don't want to make a big deal," she said.Crowley later tweeted that "J & I are good" and thanked those who "stopped to check on us and call the police."No charges were filed. Still, the event heightened the spotlight on Manziel, who has been long accused of partying too much and squandering his talents in the process. He went to an alcohol- and drug-treatment center in Caron, Pennsylvania, in early 2015, soon after the end of his rookie NFL season.Manziel also was arrested before his freshman season and eventually pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of failing to properly identify himself to police. Counts of possessing a fake driver's license and a charge of disorderly conduct by fighting were dismissed when a judge accepted Manziel's guilty plea.Last week, the Browns said: "We've been clear about expectations for our players on and off the field. Johnny's continual involvement in incidents that run counter to those expectations undermines the hard work of his teammates and the reputation of our organization. His status with our team will be addressed when permitted by league rules."Many sports media outlets have reported the Browns plan to release Manziel in March.
