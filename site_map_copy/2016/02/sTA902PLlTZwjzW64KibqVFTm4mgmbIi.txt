Story highlights Aphonopelma johnnycashi, or Johnny Cash, is one of 14 newly discovered tarantula species(CNN) An expansive, decade-long survey of tarantulas in the United States has uncovered 14 new species, including one named after the "Man in Black."Aphonopelma johnnycashi, named for Johnny Cash, can be found around Folsom State Prison in California, where Cash made a famous recording and about which he wrote a hit song called "Folsom Prison Blues." The males of aphonopelma johnnycashi are generally black, mirroring Cash's famous penchant for dressing in black, said biologist Chris A. Hamilton, who did this research while at Auburn University.Hamilton conducted the research with Brent E. Hendrixson of Millsaps College and Jason E. Bond, also of Auburn. Their findings were published Thursday in the journal ZooKeysNational Geographic said the research "rewrites scientific understanding" of Aphonopelma, an understudied genus of harmless North American tarantula. In addition to identifying Johnny Cash and 13 new species, the team reclassified 40 old names, suspending some and combining others, leaving 29 species in the United States -- down from 55 when the team started."The real surprise is just how much novel diversity we found in the United States, a place that most of the public would probably think has been surveyed really well," said Hamilton, who was with Auburn University Museum of Natural History in Alabama during the research.Read More
