Story highlights "Why add firearms to a situation where we know there is stress involved," dean saysDean fears faculty will "start censoring ourselves because" of armed studentsNew law takes effects on 50th anniversary of infamous Texas campus mass shooting(CNN) Texas' new campus gun law has partly prompted a longtime dean at the University of Texas to quit and take another deanship at an Ivy League school, he said Friday."I grew up hunting. I don't see a bunch of quail or pheasant running around the campus," School of Architecture Dean Frederick Steiner told CNN. "Firearms in my view have their place in the world, and the university campus is not one of those places, except for law enforcement and campus police."Steiner said the new Texas gun law called Campus Carry was "a factor" in his decision to leave the state's flagship university effective at the end of June.The new law could lead to campus gunfire and self-censorship among faculty who fear their grades or lectures could incite the armed students, Steiner said. He has been the architecture school's dean on the Austin campus for 15 years.He also cited how the new law doesn't apply to private universities that also receive government research funding, and he described the law as "part of a larger assault on public universities" by state legislators who have cut school funding and appointed regents who "were not sympathetic to a leading research university," he said.
