Story highlights Ohio EPA employees and supervisor fired after probe of lead in the drinking waterAn Ohio EPA manager is demoted for "not elevating the Sebring issue"Sebring is a village of about 4,400 people between Canton and Youngstown(CNN) Two Ohio environmental employees have been fired and another demoted as part of an investigation into lead levels in the drinking water in Sebring, according to the state Environmental Protection Agency.In a statement, the Ohio EPA said Wednesday that it had fired a central office employee for failing to ensure that lead-level lab results were provided to a field office, a critical step in the review process.That employee's supervisor also was fired for "not properly managing an employee who had an existing record of performance issues and not providing appropriate corrective counseling or progressive discipline despite being instructed to do so," the statement said.In addition, a manager in the Northeast District Office was demoted for "not elevating the Sebring issue" to management or the agency's director when the district informed the village of a problem on December 3, the statement said.Earlier this month, the Ohio EPA announced that tests of all 54 water samples (from 53 homes) showed "lead levels ... below the federal allowable limit." This is consistent with other recent tests indicating "improving water conditions" in the village of about 4,400 people between Canton and Youngstown.Read More
