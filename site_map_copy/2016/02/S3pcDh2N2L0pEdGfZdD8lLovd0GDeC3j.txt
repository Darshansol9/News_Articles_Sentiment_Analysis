(CNN) The populists and radicals have filled space that the major parties vacated. After the Cold War, political parties in the West started moving to the center — among others, Britain's Labour Party, the Italian and French socialist parties, and the U.S. Democratic Party. (Geoffrey Wheatcroft writes of the phenomenon in Europe in the National Interest.) The Republican Party is a partial exception to this rule. Yet even there, the last two GOP presidents — the Bushes — governed from the center, certainly enough to enrage their conservative supporters and fuel insurgencies. (George W. Bush's problems related more to competence than ideology. He did enact a massive tax cut but was a big spender, supported education standards and expanded Medicare.)Why are centrists so vulnerable? The reality is that these moderate politicians have actually performed well in recent decades. Look at the challenges they have faced: the end of the Cold War, the integration of Eastern Europe, wars in the Balkans, the rise of economic competitors, the Asian economic crisis, 9/11, the global financial crisis. Western governments have steered their countries through these difficult times with skill while maintaining peace, growing economies and adapting to a new technological age.
