Story highlights Rodriguez: " I never thought I could play for 22 years"Three-time MVP has 3,114 hits and 696 home runs -- fourth on the all-time homer list(CNN) Alex Rodriguez's turbulent career as one of baseball's most talented and polarizing sluggers appears to be over.The New York Yankees announced Sunday that A-Rod will play in his final major league game Friday at Yankee Stadium as the Yankees take on the Tampa Bay Rays. After the game, the 41-year-old Rodriguez will be released from his player contract and become a special adviser and instructor with the Yankees through December 31, 2017."This is a tough day. I love this game and I love this team," an emotional Rodriguez said at a press conference at Yankee Stadium, where he was not in Sunday's starting lineup. "Today, I'm saying goodbye to both. I never thought I could play for 22 years."The three-time MVP nears retirement with 3,114 hits and 696 home runs, good enough for fourth on the all-time homer list behind Barry Bonds (762), Hank Aaron (755) and Babe Ruth (714). He was voted to the All-Star Game 14 times and signed a $275 million contract with the Yankees in 2007 -- then the richest deal in baseball history.But Rodriguez's gaudy stats were tarnished in the eyes of many by his admission in 2013 that he had used performance-enhancing drugs. He was suspended for the final weeks of that season and all of the 2014 season before rejoining the Yankees last year.A-Rod was an incredibly gifted player.
