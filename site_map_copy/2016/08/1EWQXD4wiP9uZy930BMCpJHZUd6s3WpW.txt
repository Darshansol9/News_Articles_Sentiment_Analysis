Story highlights Ban could bring an end to a big tourism tradeSpinner dolphins are naturally nocturnal(CNN) NOAA Fisheries is proposing a ban that could bring an end to the popular tourist attraction of swimming with Hawaiian spinner dolphins. Officials say the current interaction with humans is depriving the nocturnal animals of the rest they need."During the day, they're resting in near-shore waters, so it makes them very vulnerable to dolphin-directed activities," said Ann Garrett, assistant regional administrator for the National Marine Fisheries Service.Swimming with Hawaii's spinner dolphins can be harmful to them, NOAA says."They may abandon their habitat and have increasing health problems.
