That's what it felt like, when you go over the wake and you hit the water again. ... It wasn't that bad of an impact, which was strange. And then after that, there wasn't a lot of yelling and screaming. It was fairly orderly getting off the plane."Valerie CollinsAs the pilot announced the plane was going down, Collins grabbed her cell phone. "I grabbed my phone and turned it on and got my husband's name and texted him, 'My flight is crashing,' because I wanted him to know I was thinking of him and, also, I didn't want there to be this, if it did turn out terrible, a time where he was trying to figure out if I was on there or not."JUST WATCHED 'Miracle on the Hudson' pilot hailed a hero (2009) Replay More Videos ...

"She had tried to open both of the back doors and couldn't get them open because of the water pressure. But they were open enough that the water was flowing in. And all of a sudden, she said, 'We're in the water, go to the wings.' And she looked at me and she said, 'We have two minutes.'

"When I get home, I am going to take my nose and put it by her ear, her little warm body and give her a nice kiss from Daddy. I'm alive. That's it. I don't have much else to say.""We have a second chance in life."Carl Bazariane"We were all looking to see how we were gonna die. It was really strange."On the crash landing, he said, "Usually in moments like that, you would expect chaos. It got really quiet and nobody said a word. There was a child crying. That was about it. That was understandable."Joe HartHe said passengers didn't panic on the plane. It was only after the crash when things got chaotic, he said. "It's when we got outside and in the cold water. And I mean the water was cold. Within seconds, my legs were numb, standing in the cold water."JUST WATCHED How to survive a plane crash Replay More Videos ...

I guess that's probably a better thing so that people didn't panic. But at the time, he said it so calmly. From that point until we hit the water, it was pretty quick."He said he turned on his cell phone before impact so that his body could be found via GPS.JUST WATCHED 2010: 'Miracle on the Hudson' remembered Replay More Videos ...

He said he was expecting the plane to flip over and break apart, but it didn't. "It was a great landing," he said.
