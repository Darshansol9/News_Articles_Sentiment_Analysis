That's what the Belgian prosecutor's office said yesterday of the terror network in Belgium, responsible for the Paris terror attacks in November and last month's suicide bombings in Brussels.

Mohamed Abrini, believed to be the so-called "man in the hat" in the Brussels airport attack, was arrested late last week.2. Ex-NFL star killedA former Super Bowl and college football champion was shot and killed in New Orleans over the weekend. Will Smith, who played 10 seasons for the Saints, was shot Saturday night after a traffic accident. Smith's vehicle had been rear-ended; police said he "exchanged words" with the other driver before that person pulled out a gun and shot the former NFL star. Cardell Hayes is charged with second-degree murder in relation to the incident. An added wrinkle: Hayes filed a lawsuit against New Orleans years ago after police killed his father. One of the cops named in the suit dined with Smith just before he was killed.JUST WATCHED Ex-NFL player shot, killed in New Orleans Replay More Videos ...
