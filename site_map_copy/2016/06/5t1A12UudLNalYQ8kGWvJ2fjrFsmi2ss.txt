They were returned to the Indian government Monday at a Washington, D.C. ceremony attended by U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi."On behalf of President Obama, it is my great privilege to return these marvelous objects to the people of India," Lynch said.Most of the pieces were seized during Operation Hidden Idol, an investigation that began in 2007 after Homeland Security special agents received a tip about a shipment of seven crates destined for the United States and labeled as "marble garden table sets."A focus on heritage & culture...I thank the US government for the return of precious cultural artefacts to India. pic.twitter.com/9mxjtEU527 â€” Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) June 7, 2016Read More
