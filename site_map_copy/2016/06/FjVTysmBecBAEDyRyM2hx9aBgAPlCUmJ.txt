(CNN) Federal and Mississippi authorities closed the books on one of the most notorious cases of the civil rights era Monday, saying no viable prosecutions remain in the half-century-old investigation.The decision means that no other suspects in the "Freedom Summer" murders of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner in 1964 will be prosecuted.The three men, all civil rights workers registering African-Americans to vote, were ambushed by a gang of Ku Klux Klan members that June night on a rural road. Their bodies were found 44 days later, buried in an earthen dam after an extensive FBI investigation."The Justice Department has investigated this case three times over 50 years and has helped convict nine individuals for their roles in this heinous crime," said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta , head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.The killings were among the most notorious of the civil rights era, and were the subject of the 1988 movie "Mississippi Burning."
