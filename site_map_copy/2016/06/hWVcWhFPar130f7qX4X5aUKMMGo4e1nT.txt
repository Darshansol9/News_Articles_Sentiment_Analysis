Story highlights Ex-Stanford swimmer Brock Turner's six-month jail sentence for sexual assault has stirred outrageU.S. swimming group's move is latest example of wave of condemnation for sentence being too lenient(CNN) The U.S. governing body for the sport of swimming on Friday banned ex-Stanford University swimmer Brock Turner, whose six-month jail sentence for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman has stirred widespread outrage.Condemning Turner's "crime and actions," USA Swimming said that he is not a current organization member and is ineligible for membership."Brock Turner's membership with USA Swimming expired at the end of the calendar year 2014 and he was not a member at the time of his crime or since then," USA Swimming spokesman Scott Leightman said. "As a result, USA Swimming doesn't have any jurisdiction over Brock Turner."Turner, 20, was convicted in March of the intent to commit rape of an intoxicated/unconscious person, penetration of an intoxicated person and penetration of an unconscious person.Prosecutors had asked that Turner be sentenced to six years in prison for the January 2015 assault.
