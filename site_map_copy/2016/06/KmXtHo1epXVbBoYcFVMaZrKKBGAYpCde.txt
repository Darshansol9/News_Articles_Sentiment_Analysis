(CNN) Comedian Samantha Bee's reaction to the Orlando nightclub shooting was emotional, fiery and funny. She blasted the shooter, the NRA, Florida's governor and gun culture in general during a searing segment Monday night on her show, "Full Frontal." (Warning: graphic language)She said her job as TV host required her to "stand on stage and deliver some well-meaning words about how we will all get through this together, how love wins, how love conquers hate."No way, Bee said."F**** it! I'm too angry for that! Love does not win unless we start loving each other enough to fix our f***ing problems!"But her harshest lines were reserved for the NRA, and what she considered its extreme love of guns, or as she put it, "high-capacity penis substitutes."
