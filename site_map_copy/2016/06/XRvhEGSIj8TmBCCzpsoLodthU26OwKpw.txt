(CNN) The assistant medical examiner who called Freddie Gray's death a homicide testified Friday in the trial of the police officer who was driving the van in which the doctor determined Gray suffered his injuries.Dr. Carol Allan stated "with a reasonable degree of medical certainty" that the fatal spinal cord injury that Gray suffered was distinctive, that it could only happen in a certain way and that it occurred while he was in the van.Her testimony is key in the prosecution's case against Baltimore Police Officer Caesar Goodson, who faces the most serious charges in a controversial case that sparked days of unrest in Baltimore and protests across the country after Gray was arrested and died in April last year.Allan said she based her opinion on her autopsy of Gray, interviews with witnesses and an examination of the van where she said Gray was placed face-down on the floor with feet shackled and his hand tied behind his back.Goodson's lawyer, Amy Askew, prodded Allan with questions designed to suggest Allan had stretched her medical opinion to classify Gray's death as a homicide.Read More
