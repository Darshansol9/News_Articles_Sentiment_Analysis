(CNN) He just wanted to grab a cold beer with friends, but his night turned upside down after receiving a fat-shaming message.Dillion Arnold was hanging with friends at a bar in Warwick, RI, on Wednesday when he was insulted."I was signing my slip," Arnold told CNN affiliate WJAR . "I didn't really pay attention to it yet, and then I just happened to read it and I saw it in the corner and I was like, 'Wow,' and my heart just dropped."The receipt from All Stars Bar & Grill read "fatty" in the place intended for the customer's name. Arnold shared a photo of the receipt on Facebook and outrage over this incident began to spread on social media."[The server] legit ID'ed me as 'fatty,' then he wouldn't admit it. They lost mine and my friends business," the 24-year-old stated in his post.When Tony Ambrosio, the owner of the restaurant, found out about the incident he was was quick to apologize. And he fired the server in question."We sincerely apologize for your negative experience last night. It was very unprofessional to say the least. We take full accountability for what occurred and would like to make it up to you," Ambrosio posted in the comments of Arnold's Facebook photo.The server turned out to be Ambrosio's son, not only is he out of a job, but he is also no longer allowed on the restaurant's property."That's not what I teach my children," Ambrosio told the affiliate. "Employees or my kids, I hold them all accountable."Both Ambrosio and his son have reached out to Arnold to personally apologize, but Arnold told CNN he refuses to speak to them right now.Even though Arnold isn't ready to hear from Ambrosio he did release a statement on his Facebook."I'm not looking to see Allstars get shut down or vandalized or anything. Justice has been done and it's over and done with."
