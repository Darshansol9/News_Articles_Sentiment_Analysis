(CNN) Police officers seized a trove of firearms Tuesday after stopping a New York City-bound car at the Holland Tunnel, which runs under the Hudson River and connects New Jersey and Manhattan.Officers searched the vehicle and found rifles and handguns, some of which were loaded. They also seized a helmet, knives and ammunition. Police had initially stopped the car because of a cracked windshield, according to Joseph Pentangelo, spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.Two men in their 50s and a woman in her 20s have been arrested on a "variety of charges related to illegal possession of guns and ammunition."The three are from Pennsylvania, Pentangelo said.
