(CNN) Former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno knew that his assistant coach Jerry Sandusky was sexually abusing a child as early as 1976, according to a new court filing.This date is 12 years before what had been thought was the earliest known allegation of abuse by Sandusky. The new allegation was revealed in a single line of a court document filed Wednesday -- a judge's order in an ongoing lawsuit brought by Penn State against its former insurance company.Sandusky was found guilty in 2012 of sexually abusing 10 boys during the 1990s and 2000s.
