(CNN) It doesn't get much more "Florida" than this.During a recent traffic stop in Loxahatchee, Florida, fish and wildlife officers found an alligator foot sticking out of the ashtray of a truck.Officers had stopped the truck in the Corbett Wildlife Management Area -- a swampy expanse northwest of West Palm Beach -- to check the driver's day pass. Instead, they found a scene out of the horror movie "Jeepers Creepers."Alligator parts were scattered around the cab of the truck. The driver first told officers he had hunted the gator several years ago, then confessed to killing it a few days earlier -- without a permit.
