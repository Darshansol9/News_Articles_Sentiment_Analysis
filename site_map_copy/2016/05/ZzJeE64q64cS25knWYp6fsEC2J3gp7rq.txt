Chanhassen, Minnesota (CNN) One day before his body was found, Prince was given intravenous fluids at a Minneapolis area hospital, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, which attributed that information to an unnamed source with knowledge of the investigation.The publication also says a source revealed that a paramedic responding to the 911 call from Prince's estate told law enforcement officers, staff and others at the scene that Prince may have been dead for at least six hours before his body was discovered in an elevator at Paisley Park.The newspaper does not cite a reason for the hospital visit or the administration of fluids. But in the days preceding Prince's death, his publicist said he was suffering from the flu.Carver County Sheriff Jim Olson said previously that someone dropped Prince off at his Paisley Park compound at 8 p.m. the night before he was found and he was alone, which wasn't out of the ordinary for the very private star.People at Prince Death SceneRead More
