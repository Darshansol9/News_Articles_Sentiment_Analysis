(CNN) A Vermont transgender man died on Sunday from injuries suffered in a beating that was initially investigated as a possible bias incident, Burlington Police said.Amos Beede, 38, was described by police as transient. He was attacked in a homeless encampment near Pine Street Barge Canal in Burlington, which is where police found him the morning of May 22. He suffered multiple blunt force injuries to his face and head, causing internal bleeding, and numerous broken ribs, police said in a news release the day of the assault.Beede was brought to the University of Vermont Medical Center for treatment and initially, his recovery prospects seemed favorable. But his condition deteriorated over the week until police announced on Sunday he had succumbed to his injuries.Chief of Police Brandon del Pozo said in a news release Sunday that the primary motivation for the attack appeared to be unrelated to Beede's gender identity but the department "has not ruled out the victim's transgender status as a possible additional motive." Police "will continue to view this homicide as a possible bias incident," he said.Later on Sunday, a Burlington Police spokesman said an investigation revealed the motivation for the assault involved a dispute that was not related to Beede's gender identity.Read More
