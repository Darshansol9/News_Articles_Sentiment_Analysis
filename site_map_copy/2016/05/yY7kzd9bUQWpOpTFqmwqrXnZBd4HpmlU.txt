(CNN) This is the house social media built.This is the lock shiny and goldThat got most votes on an online pollThat Facebookers chose, young and old.When Realtor Nicole White met with her friend and house flipper Mike Riccio in January, she knew they needed to incorporate social media into their next home sale. She just didn't know exactly how."I went to the meeting with the idea of this is 'The House that Social Media Built.' but didn't quite know how it would come together," White told CNN.The pair purchased a colonial home in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, and White sought feedback on her Facebook page about the sort of finishes she should use.Friends Nicole White and Mike Riccio hit upon a novel ideaThat's when the idea took off."In about two or three weeks, I had to start a separate Facebook page ... because of the overwhelming response!"As they worked through the renovation, Facebook followers sent them ideas. Door knobs, countertops, backsplashes, dining room chandeliers -- all chosen by a community watching the renovation play out online."We started hearing from people in Italy, Argentina. It was crazy," Riccio said. "The response was unbelievable."On Thursday, the house had its grand reveal."So many people showed up for the open house," White said. "It was hard to know who was a buyer, a neighbor, a curious member of the community. There were so many people, so many cars."The property was listed Friday for $389,000.The experience was so overwhelmingly positive, the pair is already looking to their next project: another home renovation -- in neighboring Branford."We've been totally riding this wave, and figuring it all out as we go along," White said.They may soon have some help.Television production companies in Los Angeles loved the idea so much, they're exploring options to turn a future project into a home improvement show.But good luck finding a name catchier than the "House that Social Media Built."
