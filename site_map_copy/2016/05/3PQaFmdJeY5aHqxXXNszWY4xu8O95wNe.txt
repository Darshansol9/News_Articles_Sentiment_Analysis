(CNN) An Internet troll found out the hard way that the kids on stage aren't the only people who can spell at the Scripps National Spelling Bee.During Thursday's competition, a Twitter user criticized the spelling bee for having a "comfort couch" for competitors to calm down after they were eliminated."Unsure of why the national spelling bee has a "comfort couch" you [expletive] lost suck it up quit teaching kids it's okay to loose [sic]."It's a mean way to talk about elementary and middle school students, who have to be 15 or younger to compete, but that's not the only problem with this tweet.The eagle-eyed folks who run the National Spelling Bee's Twitter account corrected the author's spelling in a one word reply: "lose."
