Hager, 86, told them on Monday that in the past his ill wife had told him she wanted to die, but she didn't specifically ask him to kill her.The shooting took place at their home in Port St. Lucie, which is north of West Palm Beach. The husband said he shot 78-year-old Carolyn Hager in the head while she slept, according to the arrest affidavit.
