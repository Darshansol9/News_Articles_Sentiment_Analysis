Story highlights Witnesses said 3-year-old boy who slipped into gorilla's enclosure "could have been killed at any second"The crowd's screaming seemed to agitate gorilla, onlookers said(CNN) The screams of a terrified crowd may have made the situation even more dangerous as a gorilla manhandled a 3-year-old boy who had slipped into its enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo on Saturday.Kimberley Ann Perkins O'Connor told CNN that she was trying to take a picture of a 17-year-old male gorilla named Harambe, who was peeking out of his cave, when she heard a splash and then a man screaming. A child had fallen into the gorilla's enclosure.The sound attracted Harambe, who barreled over to the moat, saw the child and then knocked the boy against a wall, O'Connor said.O'Connor, who recorded much of the scene on her phone, said the gorilla didn't seem intent on harming the boy at first."He dragged the child a little further down into the moat and he ... almost looked like he was helping him, pulled his pants up, stood him up, and then all of the sudden everybody started screaming again, and he pulled him completely out," she said.JUST WATCHED Witness: Gorilla pulled the child's pants up Replay More Videos ...
