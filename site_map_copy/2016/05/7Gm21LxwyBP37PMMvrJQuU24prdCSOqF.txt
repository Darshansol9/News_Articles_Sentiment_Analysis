Story highlights Justin Ross Harris is accused of deliberately leaving his son in a hot carJudge cites amount of pretrial media coverage in agreeing to move trial(CNN) Media coverage in the case of Justin Ross Harris, accused of leaving his 22-month-old son, Cooper, in the sweltering back seat of his car, has made it a challenge to find a fair jury, says a Georgia judge who Monday granted a change of venue for the trial.Cooper remained in Harris' car throughout the workday in June 2014, officials said. His father found him after leaving work and called 911. Charges against Harris include malice murder, two counts of felony murder and cruelty to children in the first degree.Some of the charges in Harris' indictment stemmed not from Cooper's death, but from Harris' alleged habit of sending sexual text messages to underage girls. According to prosecutors, Harris was having these illicit chats with as many as six women on the day his son died.In making her decision on the venue change, Judge Mary Staley said, "[Harris] has carried the burden to make a substantive showing of a likelihood that prejudice exists because of extensive publicity, so it would not be just to try the case in Cobb County."Read More
