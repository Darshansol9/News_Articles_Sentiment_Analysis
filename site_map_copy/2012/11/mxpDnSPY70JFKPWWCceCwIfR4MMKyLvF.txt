By Tami Luhby @CNNMoneyNEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- It doesn't take a million bucks to get into the top 1%.In fact, it took a little less than $370,000 in adjusted gross income in 2010 to make it into this elite group, according to newly released data from the Internal Revenue Service. That's up slightly from the $352,000 the year before.But on average, the top 1% earned $1.12 million, up from $980,000 the year before.The top 1% have been in the spotlight since Occupy Wall Street protesters first began camping out in cities across the U.S. last fall. The presidential campaign also centered on the haves and have nots, with President Obama calling for tax increases on the rich and challenger Mitt Romney arguing that taxing the wealthy would hurt the economy.
