I was thinking that this could not be happening to me, just as I felt back on August 6, 2006, when I was told that Josh had drowned.I never would have thought that anything good would happen from the drowning death of my only son at the age of 16.I saw nothing but disaster and tragedy from Josh's drowning. But now I see all of the positive outcomes from his death. Now I can see better what the plan was for my son's life and death, and mine. His death was so others could have a fuller life and possibly a longer life because of their knowing how to swim and (having) water safety skills.JUST WATCHED Giving kids a lifesaving skill Replay More Videos ...

Our objective is to change the drowning statistics.Drowning is preventable if you know the rules. Awareness, education and knowledge is key. That was something I did not have.CNN: What are some of your goals or plans for the Josh Project?Butts: To increase enrollment, employ our own teachers and have our own swimming facility so students can practice what they learn in their weekly lessons. And possibly increase lessons to twice a week. We also intend to increase our water safety education classes.CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work?Butts: Swimming and water safety education are basic life skills that all should know.Water is universal. And since our Earth is nearly 70% water and our bodies are 60 to 70% water and swimming is the only sport that could possible save your life, it is very vital for everyone to have water safety skills and know how to swim.
