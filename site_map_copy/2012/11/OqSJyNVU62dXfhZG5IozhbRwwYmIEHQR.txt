By the CNN Wire Staff(CNN) -- Thousands of American Indians are now in line to receive part of a $3.4 billion settlement with the federal government, ending a long-running dispute over government mismanagement of tribal lands and accounts.After an initial agreement was outlined in 2009, Congress approved it in November 2010 and it spent the last two years going through an appeals process.
