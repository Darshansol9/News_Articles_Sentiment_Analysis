Dorrell, a former Arkansas volleyball player, was a passenger on Petrino's motorcycle, but he did not initially disclose that information.Through its investigation, the school learned that Petrino, a married father of four, had given Dorrell "some $20,000" before she was hired and failed to disclose their relationship when recommending her for the job with the department, thereby giving her "an unfair and undisclosed advantage for a position on his football staff." Dorrell beat out 158 applicants for the job she was hired for on March 23.JUST WATCHED Students react to Petrino firing Replay More Videos ...

"She and I believe she should have the opportunity to move on."Dorrell agreed she wouldn't attempt to sell or profit from her affiliation with Razorbacks Athletics, officials said. The university will pay Dorrell approximately $14,000 as part of the settlement.The school announced that there were no immediate plans to re-open or publicize the job opportunity.
