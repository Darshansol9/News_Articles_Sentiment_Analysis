Teams are preparing to assess the damage on Wednesday.The severe weather affected flights and aircraft at area airports.More than 110 aircraft at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport sustained various degrees of hail damage, the airport said. It reported airlines canceled 400 departures, and more than three dozen incoming flights were diverted to other airports because of the storm.Southwest Airlines, meanwhile, canceled more than 40 flights at Dallas Love Field, while American Airlines canceled all flights through Tuesday evening at Dallas-Fort Worth, one of the world's busiest airports.The announcement, made via Twitter, was likely to affect American flights in other parts of the country.

He went to a nearby gas station, where he ran into a friend whose window had been blown out and a National Weather Service worker with a radio who told them tornadoes were touching down nearby."A girl said 'Look up.' And there were two funnel clouds that touched down about an eighth of a mile up from us, and debris was flying and we were trying to decide where to go."About that time, she said, 'Look behind us' -- and a third tornado formed behind us, but hadn't touched down," Cook said. "And about three minutes after that, the sirens started sounding."Photos: Photos: Tornadoes tear through Texas Photos: Photos: Tornadoes tear through Texas Tornadoes tear through Texas – Cambrie Thornton, left, and Royal Thornton sit outside their destroyed home Wednesday, April 4, after a tornado struck on Tuesday in Forney, Texas.

Hide Caption 15 of 15Among the most dramatic images of the day were from a freight truck depot on the south side of Dallas, where one twister flung semitrailers high in the air and hundreds of feet from their parking spots.The lot is owned by Wisconsin-based Schneider National Trucking Company. Company spokeswoman Janet Bonkowski said there were no injuries at the facility and no damage to the building, "but significant damage to the equipment that was in our yard."A tractor weighs 20,000 pounds. An empty trailer weighs 14,000 pounds, while a full one weighs about 46,000, the company said.CNN meteorologist Sean Morris estimated the tornadoes that moved through the Dallas-Forth Worth area were EF1 or EF2 twisters, at their strongest."This is fairly weak in terms of tornadoes, but we saw the awesome power of the twisters as they lifted the trailers several hundred feet in the air," he said.Damage was also reported in Kennedale and Arlington, Texas. The mayor of the latter city signed a disaster declaration to help cope with the destruction."It's extensive damage," said Tiara Richard, a spokeswoman for Arlington police. No major injuries have been reported so far, but affected areas were still being searched for people who may be trapped, she said.Tarrant County spokesman Mark Flake said about 40 homes in Arlington sustained moderate damage. The Cowboys football stadium emerged almost unscathed, according to its general manager.In Kennedale, a large water main broke, and several people were injured, said city spokeswoman Amethyst Cirmo, though she could not immediately confirm how many. The city's police chief, however, said there were no reports of deaths or injuries thus far. A community center was opened to residents displaced by the storm.Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez said the area was hit by "a series of tornadoes" that inflicted heavy damage on some of the southern suburbs."Our officers are going to several locations right now," Valdez said. She said deputies were en route to some of the hardest hit areas to prevent looting, amid reports "that some of that has already started.""We have our hands full. There are already a lot of situations where we have to go out and help," she said.But all told, damage from the storm could have been much worse, said Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings."The big headline is that we dodged a big bullet," he said. "We're saddened by the damage the system did, but we've got nobody that's dead and no significant injures. It really is a miracle."
