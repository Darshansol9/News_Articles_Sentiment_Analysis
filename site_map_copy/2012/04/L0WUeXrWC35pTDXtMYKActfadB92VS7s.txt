Story highlights Two businessmen from Vietnam buy the nation's least populous townBuford, Wyoming, sold for $900,000The identities of the buyers are being kept secretThe lot includes 10 acres, five buildings and a cell phone towerThe population of the least populous town in the United States appeared to at least double Thursday when two mysterious businessmen from Vietnam won the tiny hamlet with a bid of $900,000 at auction.About a dozen bidders gathered around the town's one business to bid on Buford, Wyoming, which consists of a gas station, a three-bedroom house and a few small outbuildings on 10 acres along Interstate 80.The bidding began at $100,000 and quickly escalated. The winning bidders were immediately whisked away by auction officials, who would not let them speak to the media.The town's only resident, Don Sammons, watched from the sidelines. He moved to Buford in 1980 with his wife and son. His wife died in 1995, and his son moved away in 2007. He had bought the town in 1990.He fought back tears as the auctioneer declared the town sold."I don't know when it will hit me. I've lived here half my life. I'm an emotional person, and I hope I handle it in an adult manner," he said.JUST WATCHED 2010: Wyoming man has his own ZIP code Replay More Videos ...

Buford is about halfway between Laramie and Cheyenne and is the second oldest town in the state."I can always rent one somewhere if I need to see my face," he said with a laugh.
