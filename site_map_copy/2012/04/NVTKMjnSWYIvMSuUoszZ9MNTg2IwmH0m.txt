"It's more like a shopping center."The group had learned how to build bombs while in Pakistan, he said."In September of 2009, three men were prepared to strap bombs to their bodies and go into crowded subways," Assistant U.S. Attorney James Loonam told jurors in his opening statement Monday.In his opening statement, defense attorney Robert Gottlieb accused the prosecution of using incendiary rhetoric to inflame the jury."These are all words the government knows will scare you beyond belief and shake you to the core," Gottlieb said of terms such as "terrorist" and "al Qaeda.""The truth is Adis Medunjanin is not a terrorist. ... In this case, the government is just wrong."Later Monday, Ahmedzay took the stand and described how his former high school classmate Medunjanin turned him on to the teaching of al-Awlaki. The American-born Muslim cleric was targeted and killed in a September 2011 drone attack in Yemen.Medunjanin's trial is expected to last three weeks.
