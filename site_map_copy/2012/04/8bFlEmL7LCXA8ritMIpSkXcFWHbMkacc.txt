Ollen said. Young is not required to stay in New York and is due to appear in court in May.The dispute occurred Thursday night. Police said Young appeared intoxicated when they arrived at the scene outside the Hilton New York hotel. He was treated and released from a hospital Friday morning, police Detective Martin Speechley said.The other man, who was not identified, sustained minor injuries but refused treatment, according to Speechley.The aggravated harassment charge is a misdemeanor, but Speechley said the case is being investigated as a possible hate crime because of "religious statements made" during the dispute.If there is evidence to support a hate crime, the seriousness of the charge would be "elevated," he said.Young plans to plead not guilty, Ollen said."I sincerely regret what happened last night," the outfielder said in a statement Friday, according to CNN affiliate WABC. "I take this matter very seriously and assure everyone that I will do everything I can to improve myself as a person and player."The team issued a brief statement Friday afternoon."We are aware of the situation, however it is our club policy not to comment on pending legal matters," the statement said. "As we understand it, this is an allegation and we need to allow the legal process to take its course."The Tigers are in New York for a three-game series against the Yankees. Detroit lost the first game Friday to the Yankees.
