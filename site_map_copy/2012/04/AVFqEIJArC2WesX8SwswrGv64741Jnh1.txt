Story highlights The two leaders call a troop relocation deal good for the regionPrime Minister Yoshihiko Noda is Japan's sixth head of government in five yearsJapan is still recovering from last year's quake, tsunami and resulting nuclear plant meltdownNoda and President Obama hold talks, then a joint news conferenceAffirming strong ties in a time of challenges, President Barack Obama and visiting Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda on Monday hailed an agreement to move U.S. Marines from Okinawa and expressed solidarity against North Korea's nuclear weapons program.The two leaders held bilateral talks at the White House and then labeled U.S.-Japan ties an essential alliance for both countries and the Asia-Pacific region.They confirmed that much of their discussion Monday focused on North Korea, which has signaled plans to conduct a nuclear test after its recent failed missile launch. The United States and Japan lead an international effort to get Pyongyang to give up its nuclear arms ambitions."There is a great possibility they will conduct a nuclear test," Noda said of North Korea, adding that the issue deepened the U.S.-Japan alliance through their cooperative efforts.Obama also noted how consultations between his government and Japan around the failed missile launch earlier this month showed the importance of the alliance."We continue our close consultations on the provocative actions of North Korea, which are a sign of weakness and not strength and only serve to deepen Pyongyang's isolation," Obama saidJUST WATCHED 2008: Japanese to U.S.: Get out Replay More Videos ...

We must avoid that," Noda told CNN last month.The prime minister faces not just the nuclear cleanup and disaster reconstruction, but an economy facing intense pressure.Japan's currency, the yen, remains at historic highs versus the U.S. dollar.A high yen makes it more expensive for Japanese corporations to make a profit when the funds are repatriated, dragging down corporate profits, domestic investment and employment.Japan's debt-to-gross domestic product ratio is highest among developed nations, topping 200%. The country is also aging at an unprecedented rate. By the year 2050, the government projects, 40% of the population will be older than 65, straining public funds while relying on a dwindling tax base.The centerpiece of the prime minister's economic policy has been the doubling of the country's sales tax, from the current 5% to 10% by October 2015.The plan remains unpopular with voters, but the prime minister has repeatedly endorsed fiscal responsibility in the wake of the shrinking economy.
