Schneiderman.Vega was married in May 2010 and allegedly "went to Aruba for her honeymoon with expenses paid for by members of the mid-Hudson community touched by her story," the statement said.The man Vega married, who was not named in the indictment, is not facing charges.Givner said the man says he was not involved in the alleged scheme.Vega remains at New York's Orange County Jail, where her bail has been set at $10,000 cash or $30,000 bond, according to the jail's record department.Vega, whose attorney could not be immediately reached for comment, is scheduled to appear in court on April 20.
