By Will Rodriguez-Kennedy, LGBT WeeklyThe San Diego Planning Commission, a seven member body responsible for recommending changes to the city’s General Plan and its neighborhood community plans, has approved a proposal that would change the name of Blaine Avenue in the historically LGBT neighborhood of Hillcrest to Harvey Milk Street, in honor of the slain gay civil-rights leader who was the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in America.If, as it is expected to do, the San Diego City Council votes to approve the commission’s recommendation to go forward with the name change, San Diego will be the nation’s first home to a street named after Milk.Because the advent a major U.S. city renaming one of its streets in honor of Milk is likely to happen in San Diego first, there is reportedly some ire among civic leaders in San Francisco, which currently has no such avenue, boulevard or street. Milk was assassinated in 1978 along with Mayor George Moscone by a disgruntled former fellow supervisor who had only days earlier resigned from the San Francisco (combined city and county) Board of Supervisors.
