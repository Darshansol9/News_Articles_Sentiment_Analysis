When 5-year-old Cooper Barton wore a University of Michigan shirt to kindergarten in Oklahoma City, the principal asked him to turn it inside-out. Much to the surprise of his mother, the school district's dress code only allows university wear from schools in the state of Oklahoma, CNN affiliate KWTV reported. The dress code, adopted in 2005, was meant to deter gangs."He was a little embarrassed," his mother, Shannon Barton, said. "It wasn't offensive. You know, he's 5."A district spokeswoman said the superintendent called the policy outdated and said that it would be reviewed.
