"And I hope to contribute by widening communication as much as I can."Social media was abuzz Tuesday with reflections of the legendary composer and his legacy."The evenings we spent with you and the Pittsburgh Pops are memories that will last forever," Jean Elliot Boyer wrote on his official Facebook page."Your banter with the audience and your down-to-earth style will stay with me forever.""The world will miss your gift," wrote Gail Dwyer.Lauded as a child prodigy, Hamlisch was the youngest student ever accepted into Manhattan's prestigious Juilliard School of Music at the age of 7. Later in life, he held principal pops conductor positions at various American orchestras, including the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and the Pasadena, San Diego and Seattle Symphonies.His passing drew comments Tuesday from a galaxy of Hollywood stars and others who sought to pay him tribute."I will miss his talent, our laughter (and) friendship, but mostly I will miss Marvin," said actress and singer Liza Minnelli. "My heart is with his wife Terre always."Nancy Reagan said she had been shocked to learn of his death, calling Hamlisch "a dear friend" whom she and her late husband, President Ronald Reagan, were drawn to by way of his "old fashioned" charm."I'll never forget that he wrote a special song for Ronnie's surprise 77th birthday party in 1988. My heart goes out to Terre at this difficult time," said the former first lady."I'm devastated," said singer Barbra Streisand. "He was my dear friend. He's been in my life ever since the first day I met him in 1963, when he was my rehearsal pianist for 'Funny Girl.' ""He was a true musical genius," she said. "But above all that, he was a beautiful human being. I will truly miss him."Hamlisch was a musical director and arranger of Streisand's 1994 concert tour and television special, and had recently worked on a musical adaption of the production of "The Nutty Professor," a musical comedy directed by Jerry Lewis.
