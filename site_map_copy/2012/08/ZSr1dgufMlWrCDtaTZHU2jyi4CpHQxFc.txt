Bush administrations.By Anita McBride, Special to CNN(CNN) -- When Mitt Romney picked -- When Mitt Romney picked Paul Ryan as his running mate , the media frenzy surrounding the announcement included claims that the choice was bad for women and that it would not attract women voters. Ryan's pro-life voting record was especially highlighted , and once again, the "war on women" came to the forefront and diverted attention from the ultimate women's issue in this election -- our dire economic future.It is misguided to think that women vote as a bloc.
