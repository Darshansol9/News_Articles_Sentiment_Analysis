MUST WATCH Sinkhole tested for radioactivity 01:43The situation is all the more worrisome because the hole is believed to be close to a well containing 1.5 million barrels of butane, a volatile liquid that turns into a flammable vapor upon release.About 150 households have been evacuated, a state official said.The widening of the sinkhole was no surprise. It "has been predicted by experts and has been gradually occurring since it first formed," said Texas Brine in a statement.Torres said the two workers are employed by Clean Harbors, which describes itself as "the leading provider of environmental, energy and industrial services and the largest hazardous waste disposal company in North America."Texas Brine Spokesman Sonny Cranch said the workers were removing debris floating in the sinkhole when at least one person aboard a rescue boat saw the land fall in and "immediately moved to a safer area, which happened to be a nearby airboat."Authorities were investigating the cause of the hole, which has swallowed cypress trees up to 100-feet tall. The company has said that a nearby salt cavern could be to blame.The cleanup operations that the rescued workers were involved in have been suspended as a precaution. Cranch said, "We don't want anyone in harm's way."
