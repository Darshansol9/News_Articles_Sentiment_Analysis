If home study opportunities are not acceptable, the student will be counseled to seek other educational opportunities," it said.In a letter sent to school officials, American Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Marjorie R. Esman said the policy "is based on the archaic and pernicious stereotype that a girl's pregnancy sets a 'bad example' for her peers -- i.e., that in having engaged in sexual activity, she has transgressed acceptable norms of feminine behavior."News that the policy would be reviewed was welcomed by Louise Melling, director of the ACLU Center for Liberty, who described the policy as "reminiscent of the '50s."August 15 is the first day of class.
