He oversaw America's diplomatic presence during a period of transition and continued fighting between NATO-led troops and the Taliban, as well as occasional friction between U.S. leaders in Washington and Afghan leaders in Kabul."He took it for two years, but the serious health problem he had in Iraq came back, so he is forced to leave a year early for genuinely serious health reasons," a senior U.S. administration official told CNN in May on condition of not being identified.At the time, Nuland indicated that Crocker would stay on through conferences in Kabul and Tokyo aimed at shaping the international approach to going forward in Afghanistan.
