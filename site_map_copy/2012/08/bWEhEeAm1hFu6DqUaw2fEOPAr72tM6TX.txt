Those who earn salaries in the millions of dollars are most likely financially secure for the rest of their lives provided they are wise with their money.

"They have resources early in their life but they don't have the business skills not only on how to manage those resources, not lose them, but how to deploy those resources and take themselves to another level in the business community."With that said, there is a new MBA program specifically geared toward professional athletes to help them maximize their financial potential."I'm living my dream right now but when this dream ends there's another one that's going to have to take place," said Brendon Ayanbadejo, a linebacker with the Baltimore Ravens.

They'll take 6 modules over two years at select college campuses across the country.Read More
