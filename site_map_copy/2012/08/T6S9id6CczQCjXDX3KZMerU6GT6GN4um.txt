Story highlights Commander of Air Force training center relieved of jobInstructors charged in sexual misconduct investigationsThe man in charge of the Air Force's main basic training facility has been relieved of command after a series of investigations of sexual misconduct by instructors at the base, according to a senior Air Force official.Col. Glenn Palmer was commander of the 737th Training Group at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio.The base has been rocked in recent months by accusations by Air Force recruits who accuse their instructors of sexual assault or other misconduct.Six instructors under Palmer's command have been charged in connection with the accusations, and a seventh has pleaded guilty to a charge of having an improper relationship with a trainee.At least 31 trainees have been victims of the misconduct.By relieving Palmer of command, the Air Force has made it impossible for him to get any more promotions, which effectively ends his military career, the official said.He will be replaced by Col. Eric Axelbank, who had been Palmer's superior at Lackland, according to an Air Force press release.In the meantime Air Force Maj. Gen. Margaret Woodward continues to investigate the problems at Lackland, and will issue recommendations when her investigation is complete.
