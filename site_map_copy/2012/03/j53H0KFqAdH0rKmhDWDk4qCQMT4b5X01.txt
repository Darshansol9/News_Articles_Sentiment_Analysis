All across America, we have critical transportation work that needs to be done and Americans who are ready to do the work."The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority will receive the funding, calling the BART extension an "unprecedented public works project" in a statement.FTA Deputy Administrator Therese McMillan said the extension would also create new construction in the housing, business and tourism sectors.The $900 million provided by the FTA constitutes 38.6% of the project's total cost.
