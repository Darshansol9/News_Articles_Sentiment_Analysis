Story highlights Department of Homeland Security and FBI warn of possible violence in U.S.The advisory says recent events in Afghanistan will be used in "extremist propaganda"A U.S. soldier is accused of killing 16 Afghan civiliansThe alleged murder of 16 Afghan civilians by a U.S. soldier could spur retaliatory violence in the United States, a law enforcement advisory by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security warned.The intelligence bulletin, which was issued Wednesday to state and local law enforcement partners, says "there is currently no specific, credible threat information" that extremists might strike targets in the United States.However, the document, which was obtained by CNN, notes the March 11 killings of the Afghans is the latest in a series of events in Afghanistan that could cause anger and possibly lead to violent action."The FBI and DHS are concerned that this event could contribute to the radicalization or mobilization of homegrown violent extremists in the Homeland, particularly against U.S.-based military targets," the bulletin said.JUST WATCHED The future of the Afghanistan mission Replay More Videos ...
