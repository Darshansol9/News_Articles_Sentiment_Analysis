Cartoon Network is owned by Turner Broadcasting, the parent company of CNN.Sebelius told students gathered at Stuart-Hobson Middle School that bullying is simply unacceptable, "You shouldn't ever have to go to class with an empty feeling in your stomach, trying to figure out what was going to happen in that class. You shouldn't be afraid to eat in the cafeteria. You shouldn't be afraid to speak up in class. That happens to too many kids too many days of the week," Sebelius told the students.Before part of the documentary was screened, students watched a taped message from President Barack Obama in which he said bully prevention is important to him both as the president and as a father."Bullying is not a rite of passage or a harmless part of growing up, it's wrong, it's destructive and we can all prevent it. I care about this issue deeply, not just as the president but as a dad," Obama said in the message.JUST WATCHED 'Bully' director: Bullying like torture Replay More Videos ...
