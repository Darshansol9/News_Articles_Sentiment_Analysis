One was the new voter ID laws, which organizer the Rev. Al Sharpton believes will keep many African-Americans from voting this fall. The other focus was new state laws cracking down on illegal immigration.This "is a resurrection of the movement across generational and racial lines and people must understand is not about one group, one race. It's about all of us," Sharpton said as he neared the end of the 54-mile journey.The march was organized primarily by Sharpton's National Action Network with support from the NAACP, AFL-CIO, Service Employees International Union, National Council of La Raza and other groups.
