Story highlights Paper is cutting the number of free stories nonsubscribers are allowed to read in halfStarting in April, number of free stories a month drops from 20 to 10Paywalls are growing as a strategy for newspapers to create new revenueThe New York Times announced on its website Tuesday evening that it has decided to cut the number of free stories nonsubscribers are allowed to read in half.People without a subscription can read 20 free stories per month on their website, but beginning in April, that number drops to 10 . Nonsubscribers will also continue to get free access to the home page. Links from Facebook, Twitter and search engines will not count toward the total.The paper says the move "will strengthen our ability to continue providing the world's most insightful and investigative reporting in journalism today, as well as support the ongoing development of digital innovations and apps that make The Times an experience you won't find anywhere else."The technique, known as a paywall, is an increasingly popular strategy among conventional news outlets to find new sources of revenue with the collapse of classified advertising and explosion of online media.The New York Times said in a statement online that "the change provides us with an opportunity to convince another segment of our audience that what The Times has to offer is worth paying for."
