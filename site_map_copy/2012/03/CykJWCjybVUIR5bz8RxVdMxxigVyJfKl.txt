Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida.But Biden said Wednesday that such fears were overblown."People talk about Hezbollah. They talk about Iranian support for weapons and the rest. I guarantee you, Iran will not be able to pose a hemispheric threat to the United States," he said.Speaking to CNN en Español in Miami, Biden said his two-day trip to Mexico and Honduras this week was a success."It was mostly about violence and what can be done to deal with the violence," Biden said.Mexican President Felipe Calderon asked for additional assistance vetting local police officers, Biden said. Central American leaders requested similar aid.Latin American leaders have repeatedly argued that drug use in the United States fuels escalating violence throughout the region.On Tuesday, Biden told reporters the United States "shared responsibility," but also noted that Central American countries must work to stop drug production.He told CNN en Español Wednesday that the leaders he met with said they were grateful for U.S. assistance."This was not one of those accusation sessions," he said.
