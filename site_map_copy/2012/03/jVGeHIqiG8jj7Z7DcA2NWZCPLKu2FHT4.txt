(CNN) -- Barbara Johnson says she was denied communion at her mother's funeral in Gaithersburg, Maryland on Saturday because she is a lesbian.Later, as she delivered the eulogy, she says Father Marcel Guarnizo left the altar and didn't return until she was done speaking. Johnson says the Priest also skipped the burial service, claiming he was sick.Johnson tells CNN the reason she is speaking out about this now is because, "we would not want any other family to go through what was the worst experience on the very worst day of all of our lives." That is why, she adds, "we believe it's important that Father Marcel is removed from parish life."The Archdiocese of Washington says it is looking into the incident and will handle it as a personnel issue.
