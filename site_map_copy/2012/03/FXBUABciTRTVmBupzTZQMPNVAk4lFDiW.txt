Arizona HB 2625 , introduced by Republican State Representative Debbie Lasko, has passed the statehouse and is now making it way through the state senate.Religious institutions are already exempted from having to cover contraceptives under existing state law, but Lasko said non-religious employers should also have the option.The bill would also remove a provision in current state law that prohibits religious employers from discriminating against an employee who chooses to use contraceptives and pay for them out of pocket.
