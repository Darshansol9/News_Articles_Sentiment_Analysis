Their sport spans two semesters, starting with October practices and culminating in March and April tournaments. They might work out in the morning, go to class, then practice in the afternoon, tend to injuries minor and major and attend study hall at night.It gets a whole lot harder when you have to worry about your kid sister.

He won ESPN.com's player of the year award. He's on many All-America teams. He'll likely be drafted among the top 5 players in April's draft and sign a contract worth nearly $4 million a year."He certainly has had a remarkable year in large part because I think he's been able to take a terrible situation, tragic, multiple situations and somehow use basketball as his outlet to somehow spin something positive out of it," Kansas coach Bill Self said. "Everybody admires him that comes in touch with him around our camp because I don't know how many guys could do what he's done."Robinson, who had 11 points and 13 rebounds in the Jayhawks' third-round win over Purdue in the NCAA tournament, leads Kansas against N.C.

He kind of had a different approach, like, you know I got to go even harder now," said guard Tyshawn Taylor.Robinson said he went to Self after his mom died and told the coach to treat him the same, to not let any "excuses" get in the way.Self remarked that Robinson's been able deal with the constant attention well. People are always coming up to the star player, cheering him on, saying how great he's doing given the circumstances."He's done a remarkably great job of balancing a situation that's really unbalanced," Self said.Robinson remembers his mother in many ways, one of which is a picture he wears around at the end of a chain around his neck, just above his heart.There is also a tree planted outside the athletic complex on the Kansas campus.

He told ESPN's Tom Friend, that soon, after he signs an NBA contract, he's going to petition for custody.Then, they will be a family again.
