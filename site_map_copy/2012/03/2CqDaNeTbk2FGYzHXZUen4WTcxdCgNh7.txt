At least 42 tornadoes swept across 10 states on Friday, the National Weather Service said.By the time the powerful storm system faded, 40 were dead: 22 in Kentucky, 13 in Indiana, three in Ohio, and one each in Alabama and Georgia.The tornadoes paralyzed a large part of eastern Kentucky, one of several states that requested Federal Emergency Management Agency teams to help conduct assessments."The damage I saw yesterday was the worst I've seen. ... It was a war zone, debris everywhere, buildings destroyed, other buildings just the walls standing, roofs gone. It was a terrible sight," Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear told reporters Sunday, describing his visit to the tornado-ravaged town of West Liberty.As the focus turned to caring for survivors whose lives were turned upside down by the storm, hundreds of National Guard troops were deployed, while good Samaritans donated what they could."When something like this happens, everybody wants to ... pull together, to help each other out. That's what it's all about," volunteer Victor Jett said.Bloomington, Indiana, resident Ron Stanhouse rushed to Henryville to help his college roommate after the storm."I had stopped and bought a generator and a chain saw and a bunch of gas and gloves, thinking maybe we were going to cut some trees and repair his house," Stanhouse told CNN's iReport, "but there were no houses there."Indiana State Police Sgt. Jerry Goodin said the destruction left authorities there with "no idea how many people are left homeless."In Henryville, about 20 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky, the EF-4 tornado destroyed schools, homes and businesses, leaving many parts of the town unrecognizable, Kevin Welz told CNN's iReport."It is something you would expect to see in an end-of-the-world movie," he said.A toddler who had survived the storm in New Pekin, about 20 miles west of Henryville, died Sunday afternoon after family members took her off life support, Jefferson County Coroner Bob Jones said.JUST WATCHED Storm damage 'everywhere you look' Replay More Videos ...
