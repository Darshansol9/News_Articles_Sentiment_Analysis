Sweeping new security measures to prevent cheating on the SAT and ACT college entrance exams were announced Tuesday.Beginning with exams taken in September, students will have to submit a photo of themselves when they apply for a test. That photo will be printed on the student's test admission ticket and the roster provided to proctors at testing sites. Testing staff will compare the submitted photo to a photo ID and to the student in person at the testing site.Photo checks will take place when the student arrives at the testing site, during breaks and when tests are handed in.Student photos will also remain in the testing databases and be checked again by high school counselors and college admission officials once scores are calculated and submitted.
