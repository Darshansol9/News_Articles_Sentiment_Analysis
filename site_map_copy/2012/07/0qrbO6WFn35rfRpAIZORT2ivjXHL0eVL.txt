The department also told them to be extra vigilant at such locations, stressing that police in the Texas city have been trained on what to do in a situation like the one that unfolded in Colorado.New York CityPolice were posted at more than three dozen New York City theaters showing "The Dark Knight Rises." The NYPD said it was not responding to any specific threat; rather, it was hoping to prevent copycats."We're just concerned that someone perhaps seeking notoriety will attempt to do something similar," said New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. "We always hear that when a high-profile event happens, so we're doing this to sort of raise the comfort level of people who are going to the movies."Tampa, Florida"In an abundance of caution," police in Tampa will increase patrols around theaters, the department said in a statement. All "traditional" theaters in the city hire off-duty officers in the evening hours, and since the Colorado shooting some have contacted the department to hire officers for the daytime, too, police said.They currently conduct active-shooter trainings for shopping malls, large employers, schools and other facilities. That training will soon be offered to movie theaters, the department said.New OrleansNew Orleans has just two movie theaters, and in an effort to protect against possible copycat incidents, commanders in the neighborhoods where those houses are located contacted the theaters to talk about their security plans, said police spokeswoman Remi Braden. "As a super-precautionary measure," they hired some officers to work this weekend, she said.District of ColumbiaAgain, "as a precautionary measure," police in the District of Columbia said they will be paying close attention to area movie theaters. That directive was given as soon as the department was made aware of the Colorado shooting, said Assistant Chief Lamar Greene. He said police are focusing on theaters in general, and in particular on places that are screening the new Batman film.Montgomery County, MarylandPolice in Montgomery County, a suburb just north of the District of Columbia, will increase their presence at movie theaters this weekend as needed, according to spokesman Capt. Paul Starks. Many theaters have their own security, including off-duty police officers, he said.
