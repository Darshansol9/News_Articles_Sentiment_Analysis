I knew I had broken the rule," Lopez told CNN. "In those cases, we are supposed to call 911 and hope they get there in time."The company fired him shortly afterward.At the ceremony Monday, Lopez met the man he saved."I would like to say a big thanks to this man.

"I know that he has tried to do the right thing."Lopez told CNN he does not plan to return to work at his $8.25-an-hour job that he started four months ago."It's another chapter in my life closed, and I am just going to continue to get my schooling finished and get on with my career," Lopez said.Meanwhile, Jeff Ellis Management announced Monday that it will no longer be providing lifeguard service for Hallandale Beach after the controversy. The company had provided the service for nine years."I take full responsibility for how this situation was handled by our company," Ellis said in a written statement.
