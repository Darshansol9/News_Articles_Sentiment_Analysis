In April, he denied allegations that he targeted women and created a hostile work environment. The accusations came amid a political fight between Congress and the White House over who should serve on the five-member commission.The accusations followed a long-running dispute between Jaczko and the NRC's four other commissioners that erupted last year into public view when letters expressing "grave concerns" about his leadership were posted on a congressional website.JUST WATCHED 2011: NRC chief denies bullying charges Replay More Videos ...
