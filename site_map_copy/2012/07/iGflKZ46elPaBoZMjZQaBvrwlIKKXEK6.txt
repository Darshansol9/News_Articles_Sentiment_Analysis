Seven U.S. Army soldiers and two Marines have been notified they will receive what the military calls "nonjudicial punishment" for misconduct while in Cartagena, Colombia, in April as part of the security team for President Barack Obama's visit, according to a U.S. military official.The official declined to be named because the information has not yet been made public.Because the unnamed personnel are not being charged with criminal offenses, the military will not disclose details of the punishment. Nonjudicial punishment traditionally has ranged from confinement to quarters, to forfeiting pay or losing rank.One member of the Air Force received a lesser letter of reprimand. The military is still investigating the role of two U.S. Navy personnel involved in the scandal.The investigation of military personnel came after nine Secret Service agents, who were sent to Cartagena in advance of the president's April trip to Colombia, were dismissed for spending time with prostitutes there.Although it has never been publicly confirmed, several officials have said at least some of the military personnel also were believed to have been involved in soliciting prostitutes.The nine personnel were charged with violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, but the U.S. Southern Command, which handled the cases, decided the charges warranted a nonjudicial punishment rather than going to court-martial.
