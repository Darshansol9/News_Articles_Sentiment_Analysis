Villaraigosa said in a statement. "I was proud to call him a personal friend for over 20 years in the struggle for civil liberties."Others echoed that sentiment."Willis was that guy who really found the joy and beauty of people. But in hindsight, he had probably been the only one like him in many rooms," California Attorney General Kamala Harris told CNN. "He was always exuberant in his infectious belief that being present and involved in the electoral process makes a difference. He was a dear friend."Edwards, who was HIV-positive, was a strong advocate for AIDS-related issues."I remember having dinner with Willis Edwards in Philadelphia at the NABJ (National Association of Black Journalists) Convention in 2011. He was never ashamed of his HIV-positive status and proudly proclaimed, 'I fought AIDS to a standstill,'" said CNN assignment editor Greg Morrison."He was a vibrant man who engaged in conversation with everybody he met," Morrison added. "His passion was making sure the African-American community addressed the issue of AIDS education without flinching."Phill Wilson, president and CEO of the Black AIDS Institute, reflected on Edwards' resourcefulness."The thing about Willis is that he was one of those people in the tradition of the black experience of making a way out of no way," Wilson said.Former U.S. Rep. Diane Watson knew Edwards for more than 40 years, going back to when he was student body president in college. She said he was known around town as "The Fixer.""Willis could get you into anything, any party, any private event. He just knew everybody," said Watson, a former U.S. ambassador to Micronesia. "Willis could talk his way into Fort Knox with two guns blazing."
