He was supposed to invest the bank's capital. Instead, prosecutors say Price used a New York-based "clearing firm" -- a dummy company set up to hide money -- to cover up fraudulent wire transfers and investments.Montgomery Bank & Trust in Ailey -- about 170 miles southeast of Atlanta -- had been in operation for nearly 90 years when it was closed Friday by the state of Georgia, with the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation named as receiver. The FDIC said Ameris Bank in Moultrie, Georgia, would take over operations of Montgomery's accounts and its two branches.Price disappeared about two weeks ago after telling his friends he had lost "a large sum of money through his trading activities," the complaint said. The complaint quoted a letter purportedly written by Price in June to acquaintances and business associates. Price indicated he planned to commit suicide off the Florida coast by "jumping off a ferry boat," the complaint said.Aubrey "Lee" Price, 46, is charged with wire fraud, and is suspected of defrauding more than 100 investors.But federal investigators, including the FBI, believe Price, who owns property in Venezuela and Guatemala, may be on the run.
