That includes 107 in Colorado Springs, 109 in Nashville and 106 in Atlanta. In Washington, the thermometer has gone past 95 degrees for nine straight days -- the longest such streak since modern record-keeping began.The high temperatures have been linked to a number of deaths nationwide.That includes five deaths -- of men ages 48, 58 and 59 and two women ages 81 and 91 -- because of "heat stress" in Chicago, city public health spokesman Efrat Stein said Friday. Another heat-related death was reported in nearby Cook County, according to Stein.Another three heat-related deaths were reported in Rock County, Wisconsin, according to Chief Deputy Coroner Louis Smit. Heat was ruled an "exacerbating factor" in two of those cases, and it was a "major factor" in the death of an 83-year-old woman found dead "from a cardiac-related condition" in a home that was 95 degrees inside and had "no cold water or other fluids."Powerful storms tied to the weather system have left dozens dead. Most recently, two people died and eight were injured when a storm struck Tennessee's Great Smoky Mountains National Park on Thursday night, park officials said.Thankfully, there is some relief on the horizon. A cold front should move across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes on Saturday, and then into Ohio and the Northeast by the following day, bringing significantly cooler air with it.
