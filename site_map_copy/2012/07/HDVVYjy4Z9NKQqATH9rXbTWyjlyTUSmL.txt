By Jeffrey Stein, CNN(CNN) -- Three times as many Asian-Americans have been running for Congress in 2012 than in the past two elections, a nonpartisan political group says, and it's a development that portends greater changes in demographic trends and reflects the recent political awakening of a minority group long confined to the margins of American society."It's extremely exciting," says Gloria Chan, president and CEO of the Asian Pacific Institute for Congressional Studies . "We could really stand to gain seats and affect the balance of power in Congress."Including Pacific Islanders, 30 Asian-Americans launched campaigns for Congress this year, compared with 10 in 2010 and eight in 2008, according to an APICS count.Though several of the Asian-American candidates lost their primaries, others stand to become the first people of Asian descent in their respective states -- New York, Tennessee and Florida, for instance -- to join the legislative body.
