Single-sex education programs have been dropped in some states under pressure from the American Civil Liberties Union, which says they can violate the constitution. Some say single-sex classes can be better for kids, though.CNN education contributor Steve Perry says parents should be able to choose whether single-sex programs work for their kids. In mixed-sex classrooms, boys are sometimes maligned for "just being boys," he said, and girls aren't encouraged to pursue hard sciences. He often directs students toward single-sex colleges, he said."If it works and has worked for so many generations, then we can't look past the facts," Perry said. "Do I know if it is, in and of itself, inherently better? No, I do not. But I do support it as an opportunity, as a method."What do you think?
