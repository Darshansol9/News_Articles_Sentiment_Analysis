Following the release of the report, you also asked each member of the Board to evaluate our individual paths forward," Garban wrote in his resignation letter to board chairwoman Karen Peetz."It is clear to me that my presence on the Board has become a distraction and an impediment to your efforts to move forward and continue the Board's most important work."Garban served as chairman of the Board of Trustees when the scandal broke and stepped down following Sandusky's arrest.In a letter posted on the university's website, Peetz said she accepted the resignation.Garban worked at the university for 33 years.
