Every day this week, we've introduced you to one member of the 2012 Fit Nation Triathlon Challenge team. Today, meet Carlos Solis, an elementary school teacher who is trying to avoid what his family's history of diabetes might have in store for him.Hi, my name is Carlos Solis. I am 49 years old, married for 28 great years and have three beautiful children, ages 20, 18 and 7.I have been an elementary public school teacher for almost 14 years. Prior to that, I held down a few jobs, including serving in the U.S. Air Force, but none have been more challenging or rewarding than being in the classroom.A few years ago, I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. I come from a family of diabetics, including aunts, uncles and, more significantly, my mom and older brother. My mom passed away several years ago and my brother is currently suffering from complications of kidney failure. He is on dialysis three days a week and has had several surgeries to help him get through. He recently has lost sight from his left eye and has very limited vision in his right.
