By Bob Crowley, CNNSpringfield, Massachusetts (CNN) – The phone rang at 3:00 am on Wednesday, November 5, 2008, hours after Barack Obama had been elected president. Bishop Bryant Robinson Jr. assumed this was his 6:00 a.m. wake-up call.Robinson, the pastor at the Macedonia Church of God in Christ here, asked his brother Andrew to phone him so he wouldn’t oversleep. He told his brother just to let the phone ring a little while, as he planned to just get up and not answer.So Robinson was a little annoyed when he heard the ringer again.Not fully awake, he had trouble processing the voice on the receiver: “They are burning our church to the ground.”
