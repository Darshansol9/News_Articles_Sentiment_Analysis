Story highlights "Help Jessica get through this," Professor Glenn McClure used to sayShe has been passionate about Africa, college president saysJessica Buchanan and Poul Thisted were rescued overnightFriends reacted with relief and joy Wednesday to the news that 32-year-old aid worker Jessica Buchanan had been freed after three months in captivity in Somalia."We are overwhelmed with gratitude," said Don Meyer, president of Valley Forge Christian College in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, from where Buchanan was graduated in 2007.She and her colleague, Poul Thisted, 60, were rescued by U.S. special forces in an overnight raid in which nine gunmen were killed, the U.S. military said Wednesday.Buchanan's family has declined to speak about the rescue until after they speak with her, but others who know her portrayed her as someone passionate about making a difference.It may have been that passion that led her to a job as a regional educational adviser for the Danish Refugee Council's demining unit.She had attended a couple of other institutions before settling in at Valley Forge Christian College. There, she undertook one of the school's most rigorous academic programs, early childhood education.JUST WATCHED Aid workers rescued in Somalia Replay More Videos ...

"It's on my bureau and I see it often," he told CNN. "I just breathe a prayer; say 'Help Jessica get through this.'"Prof. David Scolforo's daughter, Christine, is a friend and former roommate to Buchanan. "Every day you woke up wondering, 'Is this the day she's going to be free or this this going to be the day when you get news saying she's not coming home forever?'" he said.Some of her college friends said they did not even know Buchanan had been kidnapped until news of her rescue broke."It was a shock, tears of sadness that that happened to her and tears of happiness that she was rescued by the Navy SEALs," said Clarimil Christian-Delker, who studied with her.Buchanan is a devoted Christian whose passion for helping those less fortunate took her to Africa, Christian-Delker said. "Every time we spoke about doing God's work overseas, her eyes would light up," she added.The women met nine years ago, and when Christian-Delker faced a family tragedy, Buchanan encouraged her via Facebook. Christian-Delker said she did not suspect that Buchanan's recent silence on the social media site was a sign that she was living out her own tragedy.
