"It's going to be hard on them.""Pray the cops find him before I do," he said about the carjacker, in an interview with CNN affiliate WDSUThe series of events began when a carjacker approached a woman motorist sitting in her vehicle, knocked on the window and asked for the time, New Orleans police said.As the woman turned to check the time, the carjacker pulled out a handgun and told the woman to get out of the automobile, police said.Ainsworth then jumped on the hood of the vehicle, and the carjacker shot him, left the car and ran, police said.Police released a sketch of the suspect and were offering a $5,000 reward to anonymous tipsters who can help detectives find a black man, in his 20s, between 5-6 and 5-8 in height, and weighing 140 to 150 pounds, detectives said.The woman was unharmed, New Orleans police spokesman Frank Robertson said."When you have someone trying to come to the aid of someone who is in need and -- whenever something like this happens, it's a real tragedy," police Lt. Gary Marchese told WWL.Skip Gallagher, president of the Algiers Point Neighborhood Association, told WDSU that good Samaritans aren't unusual in the neighborhood."I think any other male that had heard that in the neighborhood would have done the same thing," Gallagher said.

I would have, and every male in this neighborhood would have done the same thing, and we see what happens."I'm not sure it's going to change my behavior."
