A lawsuit filed in federal court in Michigan on Monday could change the way the state laws consider same-sex couples with adopted children, CNN affiliate WXYZ reported. Current law allows only one parent to adopt kids, but if something happens to that parent, the other partner has no parental rights -- they can't sign for the kids' medical care, and the kids don't have the same inheritance rights or rights to social security disability or health insurance.April Deboer and Jayne Rowse have raised three children since birth, but state laws allows only one of them to be each child's legal parent.“Michigan has some of the worst laws in the country for gay and lesbian parents,” says attorney Carole Stanyar, who represents the couple. “And these laws in particular are hurting families, and as we can see in this case, they’re hurting children."
