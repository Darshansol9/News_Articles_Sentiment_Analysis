By the CNN Wire Staff(CNN) -- Washington moved closer to being the seventh U.S. state to allow same-sex marriage Monday when a key state senator announced her support.Mary Margaret Haugen said she would be the 25th vote in the 49-member Senate for the bill. Supporters say the legislation already has a majority behind it in the state House of Representatives, and Gov. Christine Gregoire has said she would sign it if passed."For me personally, I have always believed in traditional marriage between a man and a woman," Haugen, a Democrat from the Puget Sound community of Camano Island, said in a statement on her decision. "That is what I believe, to this day."But this issue isn't about just what I believe," she continued. "It's about respecting others, including people who may believe differently than I. It's about whether everyone has the same opportunities for love and companionship and family and security that I have enjoyed."
