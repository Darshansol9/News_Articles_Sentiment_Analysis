He joined about 300,000 other people who have signed up at CodeYear to receive free interactive programming lessons each week from the Codecademy , a web-based tutorial. I am greatly relieved.It's time Americans begin treating computer code the way we do the alphabet or arithmetic. Code is the stuff that makes computer programs work -- the list of commands that tells a word processor, a website, a video game, or an airplane navigation system what to do. That's all software is: lines of code, written by people.We are socializing, working, consuming, and living in a world increasingly defined by programs.
