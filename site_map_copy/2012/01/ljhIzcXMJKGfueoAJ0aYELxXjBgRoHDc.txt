According to the corps, they have the ability to approve, request additional information or make changes.The state office of historic preservation, which is under the jurisdiction of the lieutenant governor's office, will work with Levees.org to address concerns by the corps preservation officer and rework the application if necessary.It is unknown whether the corps federal reservation officer has received the application, according to Jacques Berry, spokesman for the lieutenant governor's office.Once the corps preservation officer gets the application, a response is due in 60 days.The National Park Service will make the final decision if the corps and Levees.org agree on the eligibility and the supporting documents for the nomination.The National Register of Historic Places was established in 1966 to recognize places worthy of preservation nationwide.
