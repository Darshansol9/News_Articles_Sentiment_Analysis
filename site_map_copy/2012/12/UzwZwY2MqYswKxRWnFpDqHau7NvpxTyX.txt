Christine Gregoire thanked the Coast Guard for finding the dock."They were out in challenging conditions looking for a needle in a haystack, and they found it," she said in a statement.If the dock is confirmed as tsunami debris, it would be the second to wash ashore in the Pacific Northwest this year.
