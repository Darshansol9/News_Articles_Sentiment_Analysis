The girls' bicycles and a purse were found near Meyers Lake in Evansdale, hours after they were reported missing.search of the 25-acre lake turned up nothing, and authorities eventually said they believed that the cousins had been abducted.About a week after the girls disappeared, investigators said they thought Lyric and Elizabeth were alive.FBI spokeswoman Sandy Breault declined then to say exactly what evidence they had to push them toward that conclusion, urging anyone with information to come forward.A $50,000 reward was offered for information leading to the successful recovery of the girls and the prosecution of the person, or people, responsible.The girls' disappearance sparked a massive volunteer search effort in Evansdale, a town of about 4,700 that is about 12 miles southeast of Cedar Falls.Last week, when the bodies were found but authorities had not yet identified them as belonging to the girls, residents gathered at Meyers Lake for a candlelight vigil, according to CNN affiliate KCRG."I guess I'm not surprised ... because of the length of time that they've been missing," Karen Carroll told the network.Carroll works at Poyner Elementary, where Elizabeth was in fourth grade. She said keeping morale up at the school has been tough.Students and staff created a "remembrance chain" that they will give to the girls' families, along with a memorial made from pink ribbons. The chain is built from rings of colored construction paper.Elizabeth's mother, Heather Collins, posted a message on Facebook last week expressing gratitude for the prayers and outpouring of support amid the "gut-wrenching news.""We know that they are up in heaven with our savior," she wrote. "Lord we know that you have them in your loving arms and we are so blessed."
