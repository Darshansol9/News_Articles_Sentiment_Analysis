We're talking about another foot in some spots."Residents of Little Rock, Arkansas, awoke to a frosty 20-degree morning after Tuesday's record-breaking 9 inches of snow -- the highest Christmas snowfall in 86 years.

"The snow is beginning to melt. It's coming off the trees now. We have three trees in the yard with at least two or three limbs broken off each one."Since it swept across the country this week, the storm has killed 10 people, including two children in Arkansas and an 81-year-old Alabama man.

As much as 2 feet of snow is possible in central Maine, leading to hazardous roads, forecasters said.In addition, "Strong winds will cause blowing snow to create potentially even taller snowdrifts," Schneider said. "Travelers across New England need to pay close attention to changing weather conditions and low visibility."Caleb Clark, a CNN iReporter in Brattleboro in southern Vermont, called it a 'classic snowstorm.' ""(It is) a nice and fluffy New England snow, not too dangerous and you could walk around without mittens," he said.Clark measured 6 inches of snow -- with more falling -- on top of his car just after 1 p.m.The storm left thousands of passengers stranded after flight cancellations.On Thursday, more than 700 flights were scrubbed, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.com.

She said she shared a photo of the crash site with CNN iReport to warn other drivers to slow down."We saw folks driving too fast and too close repeatedly the entire trip today," Winger said.

It could have been them."JUST WATCHED Watch tornado strike Mobile, Alabama Replay More Videos ...

In Mobile County, David Saraceno spotted something ominous as he sped down Interstate 165 on Tuesday. He was traveling with his wife and 1-year-old daughter to visit family when he saw a tornado on the side of the road. His wife videotaped it."It looked like it was about two miles away from us," Saraceno said. "I put the pedal to the floor to try and get out of harm's way, but it seemed to be getting closer and closer."Panicked, Saraceno got off the interstate near the town of Chickasaw, drove in a different direction and then turned around to go home."We drove right back into a path of destruction," he said. "It appeared that the tornado turned and came over the interstate about three minutes away from where we would have been if I did not get off the interstate. We saw a roof that must have blown off a house. Cars were pulled to the side of the road. There was a lady whose windows were shattered. It was too close for comfort."Winter wonderland in DallasFor others, the winter storm system brought a rare white Christmas.In Dallas, some residents had to change from short sleeves to winter coats Tuesday, as temperatures plummeted from the 60s to the low 20s in one day."We knew it was going to be a white Christmas in Dallas this year as per the weather advisory, but were not aware it will turn out to be so beautiful and freezing cold," Shail Bhatt said.
