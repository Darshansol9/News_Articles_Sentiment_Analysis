I don't even know what a children's book is. I always know that my work is deemed suitable -- more suitable -- for children. I don't believe that, but who cares? Who cares?" he said.His characters entered worlds "where you don't have to pretend to be civilized," Sendak told The Atlantic about his book "Bumble-Ardy.""Children can distort, and play with figures and ideas, with a fluidity that strains us -- which we grow out of," he said.In 1980, Sendak began designing sets and costumes for opera and ballet.According to his publisher, his productions for major houses in the United States and England included Mozart's "The Magic Flute," Tchaikovsky's "The Nutcracker" and Humperdinck's "Hansel and Gretel."His last book was inspired by his love for his brother, Jack, for whom he illustrated books."My Brother's Book" will be published in February of next year.
