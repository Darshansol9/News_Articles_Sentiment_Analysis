Floats were put under its neck to help keep its head above water.Photos and video taken of the rescue show Kelly and others placing a tow line under the horse's saddle and securing it to the boat. Harbor patrol personnel and lifeguards appeared to take turns holding the horse's head up."It took about two-and-a-half hours to escort the horse back to dry land and into the hands of a vet," Kelly said.The horse was taken to an animal clinic in the area and released back to the owner.
