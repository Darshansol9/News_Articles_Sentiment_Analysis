Story highlights Bowe Bergdahl disappeared in June 2009 in AfghanistanHis parents lead the Rolling Thunder rideRobert Bergdahl's message to his son: "Stay strong, never give up"The parents of missing U.S. serviceman Bowe Bergdahl led the Rolling Thunder ride in Washington on Sunday, trailed by the roar of what was estimated to be hundreds of thousands of motorcycles.The annual Memorial Day weekend ride, now in its 25th year, is held in remembrance of prisoners of war and those missing in action.Bergdahl, a 26-year-old army sergeant, was captured in Afghanistan in 2009 after he finished his guard shift at a combat outpost in southeastern Paktika province."Bowe, your family has not forgotten you, your hometown has not forgotten you. Your state of Idaho has not forgotten you, and thanks to all of you here today, Washington D.C. has not forgotten you," his father, Robert Bergdahl, told a cheering crowd.Robert Bergdhal speaks during Sunday's event. His son, Sgt. Bowe Bergdhal, was captured in Afghanistan in 2009."We love you, we are proud of you. Stay strong, never give up. We pray for the day that we welcome you home," he said.Flanked by riders wanting to offer support for the safe return of his son, Bergdahl spoke separately to CNN. He sported a long beard and wore a bandana imprinted with "POW." His son's official status is listed as "missing/captured.""The beard is a chronology," Bergdahl said, "of my son's captivity since June 30, 2009."Since his capture by Taliban militants, four videos of the Idaho native have been released, living proof of his well-being. But the last video was sent in February 2011, and it's unclear where Bergdahl is being held now, according to John Wagner, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command."We are still searching for him," said Wagner. "We are actively looking for leads and information on his whereabouts and his condition."JUST WATCHED What's next in the fight for Bergdahl Replay More Videos ...
