Story highlights Marian Thompson gets 2 spotted leopards, 2 macaque monkeys and a brown bearLast year, an Ohio man freed dozens of animals from his farm before committing suicideLaw enforcement killed 48 of the released animals, and 2 primates were killed by the other animalsThe 5 animals that were returned Friday weren't among those released last yearFive exotic animals once owned by an Ohio man who last year set free dozens of animals before committing suicide were returned to the man's widow Friday.Two spotted leopards, two macaque monkeys and a brown bear were returned to Marian Thompson, widow of farmer Terry Thompson, who set off a scare in October when he let loose 50 dangerous animals from his farm before shooting himself.Forty-eight of those animals were killed by law enforcement, and two primates were killed by the other animals, zoo officials said.The five animals returned to Marian Thompson were never released from their cages by her late husband. A sixth unreleased animal, a leopard, died in January at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, where all of Thompson's remaining animals had been housed for safekeeping since the incident.A state review board concluded that the animals are free of "dangerously infectious or contagious diseases." The finding required them to lift a quarantine imposed in a move in October to delay their return.JUST WATCHED Widow to reclaim exotic pets in Ohio Replay More Videos ...

"If we are pushed to do what we had to do the last time, we would take care of it."Legislation that would tighten rules regarding private ownership of exotic animals passed the Ohio Senate in April and is now being heard in the House of Representatives. "Zoo officials encourage lawmakers to pass a bill quickly to ensure public safety and protect the welfare of animals," the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium said in a news release.
