Story highlights FAMU's band director steps down after 40 yearsBoard of trustees plan to meet next week to discuss band's fateFAMU drum major Robert Champion died after a November hazing incidentThirteen people have been charged in his deathFlorida A&M University band director Julian White, who had been under pressure to step aside after the hazing-related death of a band member, is retiring, his attorney announced Thursday.White, 71, is stepping down just days after 13 people were charged in connection with the November 2011 hazing death of FAMU Marching 100 drum major Robert Champion. White was placed on paid administrative leave shortly after Champion's death.FAMU's board of trustees is scheduled to meet on May 14 to discuss the future of the band.Champion, 26, died within an hour of his being badly beaten during a hazing incident on a band bus following a football game in Orlando, Florida. The ritual, called "Crossing Bus C," is an initiation process in which pledges attempt to run down the center aisle while being assaulted by senior members, according to some university band members.An autopsy found "extensive contusions of his chest, arms, shoulder and back," and "evidence of crushing of areas of subcutaneous fat," medical examiners reported.JUST WATCHED Do hazing charges fit the crime?

How can they allow the band out there?" she said last week. "They haven't done anything to safeguard students -- certainly not my son. My son was murdered."
