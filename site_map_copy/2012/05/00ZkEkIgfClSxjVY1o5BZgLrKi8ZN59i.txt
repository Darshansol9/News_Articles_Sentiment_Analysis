Austin Lewis and Trevor Timm have been friends since they were little kids, and this month, they graduated from Partoun, Utah's West Desert High School together -- just the two of them. The school has one teacher-administrator and 10 students in grades seven through 12, CNN affiliate KSL reported."You learn a lot of life lessons," valedictorian Lewis said." Like a lot of times during lunch hour, we'd go get stuck in the mud. It's fun having the principal come pull us out with his tractor after school."
