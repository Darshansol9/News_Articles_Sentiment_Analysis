Story highlights One World Trade Center is now 1,271 feet, the tallest building in New YorkPlans call for it to become the nation's tallest at 1,776 feet as construction continuesBut a design change could jeopardize that planThe design change involves a 408-foot needle to be placed atop the buildingA design change to One World Trade Center might jeopardize its plans to become the tallest U.S. building.As the building is designed now, a 408-foot needle atop the tower will be enclosed in a radome, an architectural structure made of fiberglass and steel. This design element would elevate the tower to its symbolic height of 1,776 feet and make it the tallest building in the country, according to building developers.But the proposed radome -- short for radar dome -- would not be able to be serviced or maintained, so the cladding was rejected.Without the cladding, the needle could be classified simply as an antenna added to the structure, and not part of the true height of the skyscraper.The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, an independent organization that certifies the official height of skyscrapers and acknowledges record setting buildings, counts spires and structural elements such as radomes in its height calculations, but not antennas, according to its website,"The only reason it's coming out of the design is because it's hard to maintain," Jordan Barowitz, spokesperson for the developer Durst Organization Inc., said of the radome. He referred to its maintenance as "stuff out of Mission Impossible."JUST WATCHED Kelly: One World Trade powerfully built Replay More Videos ...

A final determination will be made by the CTBUH Technical Height Committee based on analysis of the drawings and other information submitted by the building owner, development and consultant team. Building designs often change during construction and final ratification of the height and formal recognition on the list of 100 Tallest Completed Building in the World occur after the building is officially completed and application details submitted," the council said.A spokesman for the building owner, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said they are not worried that the design change will significantly alter the structure's height."If truth be told, this discussion is irrelevant. One WTC will be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere," said Steve Coleman, the port authority's spokesman.The tower became the tallest building in New York in April when the placement of a column of the 100th floor brought it to a height of 1,271 feet, surpassing the frame of the Empire State Building by 21 feet.
