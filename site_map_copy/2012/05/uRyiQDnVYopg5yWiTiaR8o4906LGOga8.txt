The flames picked up significantly the next day, fanned by strong winds and high temperatures.Since then, the wildfire has taken its toll. While noting that the entire affected area has not been surveyed, the state department said at least 97 structures on 39 different properties have been "lost" due to the blaze.Dry conditions have exacerbated the fire danger throughout the region.On Friday, Gov. Rick Snyder banned outdoor burning in 49 counties in northern Michigan in hopes of preventing wildfires.
