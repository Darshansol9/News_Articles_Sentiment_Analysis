Zuccotti Park is located in the city's financial district.The group's messages have ranged from protecting the environment to protests over education costs. There's been an overriding theme of condemning income inequality and social injustice.It put out a statement Sunday, saying "the day's events are about flexing people power in the streets and utilizing public spaces.""The Occupy movement continues to utilize culturally creative tactics to build the movement for social and economic justice," the group said.The movement also has been criticized for its lack of focus, and over reliance on a physical space."The camp is one of the central points for the first couple of months and that's just not a sustainable form of protest," said Fordham University professor Heather Gautney, referring to Zuccotti Park."So I think there was a transition into more localized acts of protest but they never really had the momentum that the camps had."Occupy had "a problem of transitioning into a new strategy," she said.The group's mantra has traditionally been directed against the so-called privileged 1 percent of society -- such as banks, the mortgage industry, insurance providers and others.The 99 percent is a reference to the broader public, which the group said had been undermined by those institutions.
