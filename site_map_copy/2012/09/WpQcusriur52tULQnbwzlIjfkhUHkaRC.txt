The book was not pre-approved by the Pentagon.Panetta, who was the CIA chief who oversaw the May 2011 raid in Pakistan that killed the al Qaeda leader, said authorities "are currently reviewing that book to determine exactly what is classified and what isn't."JUST WATCHED SEAL: I didn't recognize bin Laden Replay More Videos ...
