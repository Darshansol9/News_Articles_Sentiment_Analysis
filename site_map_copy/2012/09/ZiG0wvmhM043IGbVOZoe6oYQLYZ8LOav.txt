by Stan Wilson, CNNLos Angeles (CNN) -- School teachers should be held accountable for the performance of their students, the Conference of Mayors said Tuesday, according to the group's leader."The Conference of Mayors unanimously supports student growth over time as a measurement in teachers," said Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who presides over the conference as president. "That should be at least one of the elements of their evaluation, and if you ask mayors across the country, they will agree."The 59-year-old Democrat told reporters that the issues in New York and Los Angeles, the largest and second-largest public school districts in the nation, are similar to those in Chicago, the third-largest, where thousands of teachers have been on strike since Monday."These aren't radical notions, and my hope is the parties will sit down and figure it out. The public wants to see more accountability," he said.
