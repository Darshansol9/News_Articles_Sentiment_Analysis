"And he died by a gunshot wound -- self-inflicted."Police did not immediately give a motive for the shooting.Raymond Thomas "R.T." Rybak Jr. said that he visited the business about a month ago and that it was rapidly expanding around the world "because they have such cutting-edge technologies."Accent Signage Systems specializes in interior signs that help the visually impaired, CNN affiliate KARE reported.

"He came running up the side of the road and asked for the phone because he was running from the shooter."Gasterland told KARE that the employee saw his boss and best friend get shot, along with two others.In a statement, Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said he deplored the "senseless" shooting. "There is no place for it anywhere in Minnesota," he said.
