By Michael Martinez and Mariano Castillo, CNN(CNN) -- A legal chapter closes now that a federal judge has lifted an injunction on Arizona's "show me your papers" provision of its tough immigration law, but the legal combat won't end and will merely take a new direction, analysts and attorneys say.At the same time, implementation of the law will heighten a wary relationship between police who must enforce the law and Latinos who allege it will inevitably cause racial profiling. The court's demand for evidence of such profiling is prompting Latino advocates to police the police and monitor arrest practices.The controversial provision authorizes local police, while performing other state law enforcement duties, to check on the immigration status of people they stop for another reason. The federal judge in Arizona this week based her decision on a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding the provision, she said.
