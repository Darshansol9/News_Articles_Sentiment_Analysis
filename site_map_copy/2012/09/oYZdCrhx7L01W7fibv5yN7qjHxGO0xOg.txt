A majority of Latinos have voted for the Democratic candidate in every presidential election dating back to 1960 . That's 13 elections, loyally casting votes for strong candidates and weak ones. Over the last half-century, a lot of Democrats have owed their political careers to voters with names such as Gutierrez, Rodriguez or Morales.
