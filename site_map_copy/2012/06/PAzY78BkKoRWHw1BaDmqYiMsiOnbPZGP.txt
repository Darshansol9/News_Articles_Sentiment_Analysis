Imagine how it is in a classroom without a fan, without an AC," Bernardini said.According to the National Weather Service, Baltimore and Washington reached high temperatures of 98 degrees on Thursday. Farther north, Boston, New York and Philadelphia reached, respectively, 95, 93 and 97 degrees, the service said.The service advises residents to drink plenty of water, to stay out of the sun, to take frequent breaks in shaded or air-conditioned environments and to check on relatives and neighbors during the heat wave.Young children and the elderly are especially at risk for heat-related injuries, the service said.Last year, it reported 206 heat-related deaths. In the past decade, heat has been the second-leading cause for weather-related fatalities, the service said.Residents are advised to call 311 or to go to their city's website online to find cooling centers and to get further information on how to keep cool as the heat continues.
