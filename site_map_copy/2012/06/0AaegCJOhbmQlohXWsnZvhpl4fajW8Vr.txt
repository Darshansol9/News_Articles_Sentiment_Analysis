The Marine Corps has expanded an investigation into misconduct by Marines captured on video urinating on dead Taliban fighters in Afghanistan.New video has been obtained by commanders showing additional potential misconduct, according to a Marine Corps official. The official declined to be identified because of the ongoing investigation"Based on information that came to light during the command investigation, the commanding general of Marine Corps Combat Development Command has determined that further inquiry into possible misconduct by members of the unit involved in the incident depicted in the video is required. This is necessary to have as complete of an understanding as possible of what actions took place," said Marine Corps spokesman Colonel Sean Gibson.The investigation began after the video emerged earlier this year showing four Marines urinating on dead bodies. The Marine official was unaware if the newly obtained video included additional Marines, or what the exact nature of the new potential misconduct was.So far, two investigations into the urination video have been completed. One was done by the U.S. Naval Criminal Investigative Service into potential criminally liable activity.The other was a so-called "command" investigation into the circumstances surrounding the video and what factors may have contributed to it being made. Both are now undergoing an internal legal review by the Marine Corps.
