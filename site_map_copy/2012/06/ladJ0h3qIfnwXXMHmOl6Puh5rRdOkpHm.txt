Story highlights It's soon expected to top off at 1,776 feet, by way of spire affixed to its peakPresident Barack Obama is expected to visit the site on ThursdayThe building is expected to open in about a year and a halfWorkers are gearing up for the president's visitIt has risen -- floor by floor, gleaming steel beam by steel beam -- from the scene of what was incomprehensible destruction more than a decade ago.Now, as 1 World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan stretches closer toward being the tallest building in the United States, it already stands as an icon in its own right.Punctuating the Manhattan horizon, the once-named "Freedom Tower" also was once fraught with controversy and costly redesigns . But it's soon expected to top off at 1,776 feet -- technically edging out the Willis Tower in Chicago by way of decorative spire affixed to its peak, and replacing the Twin Towers that fell to terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001."Everybody takes pride in this building," says Marc Becker, deputy general superintendent of the construction firm Tishman. "Everyone's an important piece of the puzzle, whether you're an iron worker, whether you're a painter, everyone has a job to do.""We're all here to see this through to the end," adds Becker.Crews at the site are gearing up for President Barack Obama's visit Thursday to the work-in-progress -- which now has reached 104 stories -- for an update on its upward growth.JUST WATCHED Time-lapse: New World Trade Center tower Replay More Videos ...

"The perimeter is steel, the core is concrete."He calls it "the strongest concrete we've ever used in New York, maybe in the United States, for an office building.""The walls are extremely thick, and all of the building supplies, elevators, all the risers, all telecommunications are within that concrete structure inside the building," he says.From the 92nd floor, workers are able to watch planes approach the New York region's three major airports, a subtle reminder, they say, of the thousands who died on that September day."Tower One, when it's complete, will symbolize everything that was lost in 9/11," Pinelli says. "It also will symbolize our resiliency as a nation, all the hard work put in by everybody."
