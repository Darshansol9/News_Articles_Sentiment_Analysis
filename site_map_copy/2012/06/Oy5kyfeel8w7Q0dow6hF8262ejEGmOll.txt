"Patrol, mop-up and chipping activities will be ongoing all day."An evacuation order in Mogollon was lifted for residents and business owners Monday; on Wednesday, the community will be open to the public, the fire service said.The Baldy Fire started May 9 in an inaccessible area of the rugged wilderness and the Whitewater Fire was reported on May 16 several miles away, according to Forest Service officials.The two fires in the Gila National Forest merged May 23, enhanced by drought and sustained winds of 40 mph to 50 mph, authorities said.Extreme drought could mean the smoke in the region will persist until the monsoon season, which typically begins in July, said Catherine Torres, secretary of the New Mexico department of health.The blaze is 15 miles east of Glenwood, New Mexico.
