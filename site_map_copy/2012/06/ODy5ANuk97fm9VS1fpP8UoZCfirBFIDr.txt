By the CNN Wire Staff(CNN) -- Even though he misled the court about his finances, George Zimmerman should not be jailed as he awaits trial for the death of Trayvon Martin because the state's case is weak and his claim of self-defense is strong, defense attorney Mark O'Mara argued Friday.O'Mara asked that Zimmerman be released on the same $150,000 bond granted by Judge Kenneth Lester Jr. in April after Zimmerman's wife and family testified they had little money. In reality, Zimmerman and his wife had collected more than $150,000 in donations from the public.Lester revoked Zimmerman's bond on June 1, after learning that the defendant and his wife had failed to disclose the donations. The judge did not immediately rule on O'Mara's new bond request, which prosecutors opposed.Lester did not say when he would rule, but O'Mara told reporters after the hearing that he expects the judge to spend the weekend reviewing the evidence before ruling.
