"We're doing our best and have enough resources on board to rotate in and relieve them."They've had "some success, some failure" in containing the advance of flames eastward and southward, toward residential areas, he said.Residents should be able to return to two evacuated neighborhoods later Wednesday and perhaps three areas Thursday, said Nick Christensen of the Larimer County Sheriff's Department.Mark Engle's family decided not to leave their Colorado home despite the thick smoke billowing through the air outside Tuesday. From a window, he watched deer grazing in his backyard, driven out of the forest by flames that have devoured thousands of acres of land only a few miles away. His children's backpacks were placed by the door, stuffed with their favorite toys.His family was packed and ready to leave in a hurry, Engle said.But they wanted to stay put, even though authorities have ordered residents in the area to clear out."There's a number of people like myself, (for whom) packing up and leaving when you have livestock and animals just isn't as easy as if you have just a house," Engle said.First measured at two acres early Saturday, the High Park Fire -- which officials say was caused by lightning -- has grown exponentially in the time since.President Barack Obama telephoned Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper on Tuesday and said his administration is already making personnel, equipment and federal grants available to the state to help in the effort.The huge plumes of smoke from the High Park fire are visible from miles away, casting a somber shadow even over communities well outside the danger zone.CNN iReporter Dave Thrush, a musician from Denver, posted dramatic pictures of smoke darkening the skies above the Colorado State University campus Sunday."The fire is 20 miles from the campus, so no one is in danger there, but the billowing smoke is still very eerie," he wrote.Another CNN iReporter, goodline69, a restaurant server in Lafayette, Colorado, told CNN on Monday: "It was a beautiful day in Fort Collins with business as usual for many, it seemed, so it was a bit surreal to be watching homes being destroyed from across the reservoir."I found myself watching the crowd watch the fire. Heartbreaking."
