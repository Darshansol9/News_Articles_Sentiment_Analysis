MUST WATCH Report cites Chris Brown, Drake brawl 01:41Parker was "sitting at a separate table, apart from Drake and Brown," the suit said. "As a result of the altercation at the club that night, (Parker) was caused to suffer severe personal injuries."The suit alleges that the owners and operators of the nightclub were "negligent in permitting Drake's entourage and Brown's entourage to be in the club at the same time despite known tension between the two" and contends the owners failed to provide "sufficient and efficient security."Last week, Brown representative Jeff Raymond said a "brutal attack" injured Brown, his model girlfriend Karrueche Tran and his bodyguard.Brown and others in his group have been interviewed by New York police, Brown's spokesman said last week. A New York Police spokesman also confirmed last week the department was investigating the incident.Brown was partying with friends in the VIP section of the South Village club W.i.P., while the rapper Drake and his friends were nearby, according to statements from the artists' representatives.Some online reports said the incident began when Drake and Brown argued over Brown's ex-girlfriend Rihanna, whom Brown was convicted of assaulting three years ago.But the confrontation was not about Rihanna, a source close to Brown told CNN. The same source would not confirm if Drake, who has dated Rihanna, was involved.Brown's spokesman disputed one online report that someone in Brown's group escalated the confrontation by taunting Drake. "No one in Chris' camp was inciting the other party," he said.Brown posted a photo of his injury -- which appeared to be a half-inch gash on the left corner of his chin -- on his Instagram account.Brown is on probation for another two years, until 2014, the result of his guilty plea to assaulting Rihanna on the eve of the 2009 Grammy Awards.The club's initials stand for "Work in Progress," Parker's lawsuit says.
