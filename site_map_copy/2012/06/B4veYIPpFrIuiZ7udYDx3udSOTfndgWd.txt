Wade Davis didn't come out as gay while he was playing in the NFL -- "I became a great actor," he said -- but "if I had to do it all over again, I would come out."Davis recently told the story of his double-life to OutSports.com , and said he now realizes the positive impact an openly gay athlete could have on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth. In his job now, he works with LGBT kids, he told Soledad O'Brien on CNN's "Starting Point" -- and it's the best job he's ever had.
