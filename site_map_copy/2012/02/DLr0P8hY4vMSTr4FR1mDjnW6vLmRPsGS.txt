Cady.It's not clear what's prompted the mass deaths, but recent changes in water temperature could be a contributing factor that has disoriented the mammals, said Wellfleet harbormaster Michael Flanagan.Once beached, they are vulnerable to predators and susceptible to organ damage and sunburn."Usually in the winter, the harbor ices over and inhibits the animals from coming close to the shore," Flanagan said. "But now that the water is warmer, we're seeing lots more dolphins washing up than ever before."Still, the strandings and causes of death are not clear, said Rowles, who added that the region has not experienced this kind of phenomenon in over a decade.In a similar incident last year, dozens of dead seals were found along the Maine and northern Massachusetts coastlines.
