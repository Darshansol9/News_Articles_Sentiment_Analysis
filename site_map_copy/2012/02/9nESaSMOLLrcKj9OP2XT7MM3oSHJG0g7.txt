The headline was up for 35 minutes before being removed."We are conducting a complete review of our cross-platform editorial procedures and are determining appropriate disciplinary action to ensure this does not happen again," the network said in a statement. "We regret and apologize for this mistake."The network also apologized for a question an ESPN anchor posed Wednesday night when asking about Lin."ESPN apologizes for the incident, and is taking steps to avoid this in the future," the statement said.Anchor Max Bretos asked, "If there is a chink in the armor, where can Lin improve his game?"
