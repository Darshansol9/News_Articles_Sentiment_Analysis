In schools across the United States, students report the same kinds of trouble: bullying, harassment, being called "gay" or "slut," says Jessie Klein, author of "The Bully Society: School Shootings and the Crisis of Bullying in Americaâ€™s Schools," which comes out in March.So, as parents, educators and law enforcement replay what led to a school shooting at Chardon High School in Ohio on Monday, Klein, an assistant professor of sociology and criminal justice at Adelphi University, says they shouldn't look for "red flags" from the student. Instead, she says, focus on creating a "culture of caring" at schools."School shootings are just one symptom of a culture of despair in our schools," Klein said. "There's just a culture of hostility in their schools and different students react to it in different ways."
