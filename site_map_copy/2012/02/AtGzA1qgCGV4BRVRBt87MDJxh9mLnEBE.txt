A five-year photo project done by Dawoud Bey shows everyday life in Harlem during the late 1970's.“I still visit Harlem when I am in New York," he said. "It is certainly a very different place, both physically, with hotels and condominium buildings along with lavishly restored brownstones, and demographically, with the increasing presence of non-black residents. The economic demographics continue to change also, with homes now selling for millions of dollars.”Images were first shown at the Studio Museum in Harlem, but now the Art Institute of Chicago have taken the vintage prints and will publish the book "Harlem, USA" with Yale University press and an exhibition of the work will also open at the Art Institute of Chicago in May 2012.
