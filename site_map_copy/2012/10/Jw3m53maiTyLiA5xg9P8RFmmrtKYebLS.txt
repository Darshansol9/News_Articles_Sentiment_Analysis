But Disney's attempt has turned into a case study of how not to market a product to any group, let alone Hispanics.Talk about magic. Apparently, Disney has the power to take Hispanics and "de-Hispanicize" them. You start off chocolate, or cafe con leche. Then, suddenly, abracadabra, you're vanilla!The first casualty is Princess Sofia.
