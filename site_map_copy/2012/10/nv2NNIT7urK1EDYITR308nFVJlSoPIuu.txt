Endeavour's final flightSpencer Niegocki, 10, salutes Endeavour from the top of a playground slide as the shuttle is flown over Tucson, Arizona, on Thursday, September 20. "Years from now, he will be able to look back and say he saw the last shuttle get carried to its final home," said his father, Dann Niegocki. "He may not understand it now, but we all participated in something impressive through the shuttle program."
