By Emanuella Grinberg, CNN(CNN) -- They're familiar characters in the debate over controversial Halloween costumes: suicide bombers, geishas, gangsta rappers, rednecks and sexy nurses.Such costumes regularly draw allegations of racism, sexism or insensitivity. But where do fully-clothed folk legends fit in?American Apparel featured characters on both ends of the spectrum this month in its annual do-it-yourself Halloween costume guide . Below a collection of pin-up girl costumes -- including a model donning a breast-baring serape -- was "La Llorona," the ghostly weeping woman who kidnaps wandering children, according to folklore in parts of Latin America.True, she was wearing a lace bustier under a shawl, but the layers upon layers make her appear more like the haunted bag lady than a sexy spirit.
