Alabama officials had requested a new hearing, arguing that the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals' August decision was "erroneous.""The panel's conclusions on these issues are important and wrong, They were not compelled by (the U.S. Supreme Court's July decision on Arizona's immigration law), and they were contrary to other precedents," Alabama said in a court filing.The blocked parts of the Alabama law include language that made it a crime for undocumented immigrants to work or solicit work; imposed criminal penalties to hide "an alien" or rent property to anyone in the United States illegally; and required state officials to check the immigration status of children in public schools.Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.JUST WATCHED Selma marchers take up immigration cause Replay More Videos ...
