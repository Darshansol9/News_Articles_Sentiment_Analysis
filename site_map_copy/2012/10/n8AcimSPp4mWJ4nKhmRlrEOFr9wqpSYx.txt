by Lindy Royce-Bartlett, CNNWASHINGTON, D.C. (CNN) -- Education Secretary Arne Duncan believes that America's decision on Election Day will greatly impact the state of education."The choice facing our country today is pretty stark. I believe we are at a fork in the road. Some folks see education as an expense government can cut in tough economic times," Duncan explained during a luncheon at the National Press Club Tuesday afternoon. "President Obama and I see education as an investment in our future -- the best investment we can make. Especially -- especially in tough economic times."To get feedback and "take the pulse of people after nearly four years in office," Duncan recently went on a cross-country bus tour themed 'Education Drives America.' After taking part in over 100 events in twelve states, Duncan says it is clear that "the real work of improving schools doesn't happen in Washington but in cities and towns all across America-where parents, teachers and community leaders work together toward a common goal."
