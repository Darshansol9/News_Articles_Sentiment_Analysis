He also declined to comment on whether any weapons had been found.Lanny Breuer, assistant attorney general for the Criminal Division of the Justice Department, said investigators are at the scene."Every time that a law enforcement person is either killed or shot or injured in the line of duty, we have to take a moment and think of our families and think of the heroes involved," Breuer said.Agent Ivie is the 14th killed in the line of duty since 2008, including three this year.He was killed near a border station recently named for Brian Terry, whose 2010 death led to the public disclosure of the botched Fast and Furious gun-smuggling sting, according to Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa."There's no way to know at this point how the agent was killed, but because of Operation Fast and Furious, we'll wonder for years if the guns used in any killing along the border were part of an ill-advised gunwalking strategy sanctioned by the federal government. It's a sad commentary," the Republican senator said.Turgal declined to comment on whether there could be a possible Fast and Furious connection to Tuesday's killing.
