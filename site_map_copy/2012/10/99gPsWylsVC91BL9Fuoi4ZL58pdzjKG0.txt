A telephone call by CNN to the New Jersey-based company early Thursday morning was not immediately returned.City officials were working to clean up the leak, Clawson told CNN affiliate KTRKNone of those exposed to the chemical cloud sustained life-threatening injuries, according to KTRK.It wasn't immediately known what the chemical was being used for at the facility. Hydrochloric acid has a number of industrial uses. It also has a corrosive effect on human tissue, with the potential to damage the lungs, eyes, skin, and intestines.It is not the first time the residents of Texas City have dealt with a threat from a chemical leak.In March, an acid leak was reported at BP's refinery in the port city. And last year, several dozen homes were evacuated when 250,000 gallons of gasoline spilled following a pipeline rupture.
