By Blake Ellis, CNNMoneyNew York (CNNMoney) -- A year after graduating from college, women are earning thousands of dollars less per year than their male peers.Women who worked full-time jobs one year after receiving their diplomas earned 82 cents for every dollar men earned. That's according to a report from the American Association of University Women, which analyzed data from a Department of Education survey of 15,000 graduates conducted in 2009, the most recent data available.While men earned average salaries of $42,918, women earned $35,296 -- a nearly $8,000 difference, the report found."You hear in the news that [millennial] women are now out-earning their male peers, but what we found in looking at those emerging from college is that there is still a gender pay gap," said Catherine Hill, director of research at AAUW.
