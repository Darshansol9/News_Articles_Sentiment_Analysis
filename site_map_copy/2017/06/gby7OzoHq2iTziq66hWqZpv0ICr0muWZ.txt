(CNN) Just as rush hour was winding down, Muslim activists and allies broke fast on the sixth day of Ramadan outside Trump Tower in Manhattan.Two advocacy groups, MPower Change and the New York State Immigrant Action Fund, invited community members Thursday to protest President Donald Trump's continued xenophobic policies.This time they were not chanting or carrying signs, but gathering for iftar. It's the first meal eaten by Muslims after sunset during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fast and prayer.Police officers stood on Fifth Avenue -- one of the busiest streets in the country -- and watched as a large group of Muslims and supporters sat between security barriers steps away from the entrance to Trump's midtown Manhattan building."Everyday American Muslims are confronted with bigotry and hate while commuting to work and school, applying for jobs, practicing their faith and simply living their lives," said Anu Joshi, deputy director of the New York State Immigrant Action Fund when the group was ready to began iftar.
