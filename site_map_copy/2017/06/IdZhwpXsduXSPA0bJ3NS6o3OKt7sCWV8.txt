Wyoming, Ohio (CNN) After the bagpiper led 2,500 mourners out of the high school but before Otto Warmbier was laid to rest Thursday, one of his former counselors stopped to remember the 22-year-old who died last week after 17 months of detention in North Korea.The tight-knit community near Cincinnati had spent nearly a year and a half "holding our breaths, praying for a quick release, rallying around the Warmbiers as much as possible" amid a dearth of information about the college student's fate, said Cynthia Meis, director of college counseling, who joined the Wyoming High School faculty in 2012.Warmbier's alma mater was packed Thursday, as the community came to terms with its sorrow over his death -- and celebrated what Meis described as his rare combination of intelligence, affability and sincerity."He was going to set the world on fire, which is why this loss is so profound," she told CNN.Fred and Cindy Warmbier, left and center, watch as the casket of their son is carried out of his funeral.Andrew Kraner, 25, who knew Warmbier from school and swimming "up the hill at the YMCA," said the 45-minute funeral service featured a blend of serious and lighthearted moments -- which "really spoke to Otto's character." Despite the uplifting celebration of his ex-classmate's life, Kraner lamented "a very bright future that we'll never know.""Everything they say about Otto is very true. He was the nicest kid," he said. "It's tough, and my heart's very heavy for him."A town ralliesThe funeral included a display of belongings Otto Warmbier took with him while traveling abroad.Wyoming High's arts center can hold only 800 people, nowhere near large enough to accommodate those wishing to bid Warmbier farewell.
