Gulf states shakeupSaudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates have all suddenly severed diplomatic ties with Qatar . Egypt has broken off diplomatic relations with Qatar, too. This is big deal for the Mideast and has a global impact as well. So what's going on? Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE are in a regional alliance called the Gulf Cooperation Council -- which has been around for almost four decades -- so they've obviously all had pretty good relations until now. The countries say they're isolating Qatar over concerns about terrorism. It may partially be a reaction to a Qatari emir's reported praise of Iran. As you probably remember, Saudia Arabia has long been at odds with Iran, which is a strong backer of Qatar.Some observers think the Saudis and the other countries are flexing a little muscle after President Trump urged the Gulf nations to do more against terrorism during his visit to the region last month.There are some immediate, real consequences to all of this: The UAE is kicking out Qatari residents and barring Qatari nationals from entering the country; Bahrain is expelling Qatari diplomats and closing up airspace and ports between the two countries. Qatar calls the severing of diplomatic ties "unjustified."JUST WATCHED Nations cut ties with Qatar Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Nations cut ties with Qatar 02:433. Portland protestsPortland, Oregon -- still reeling from last month's deadly stabbings on a commuter train -- had to deal with more unrest over the weekend, this time in the form of protests. At least 14 people were arrested when hundreds of President Trump's supporters faced off against a slightly larger group of counterprotesters. The President's supporters were holding a "Trump Free Speech" rally. The counterprotesters viewed it as an endorsement of racism and hate since the rally came so close after two men were stabbed to death while coming to the defense of teens facing anti-Muslim slurs. Police separated the two groups, so the counterprotesters took out their frustrations by hurling bottles, bricks and balloons with a "foul-smelling liquid."JUST WATCHED Tensions rise at Portland protests Replay More Videos ...

And it's about to get worse, according to a new report. Roughly a quarter of American shopping malls will be gone within the next five years, says Credit Suisse, a global financial services company based in Switzerland. And you probably have already guessed why such doom and gloom is predicted -- online shopping. Right now online sales are 17% of retail sales, but by 2030 they're expected be about 35%.JUST WATCHED Empty US shopping malls a sign of the times Replay More Videos ...
