(CNN) Once again, United Airlines is dealing with a customer controversy.Shirley Yamauchi said the airline gave away her 2-year-old son's seat on a recent flight, forcing him to sit in her lap for over three hours."He's 25 pounds. He's half my height," Yamauchi told CNN affiliate KHNL . "I was very uncomfortable ... I lost feeling in my legs and my left arm."Yamauchi and the toddler were on the last leg of an 18-hour journey from Hawaii to Boston. When they stopped in Houston, a male standby passenger came on board with a ticket showing the same seat number as her son.After a man was dragged off an overbooked United flight in April , Yamauchi said she didn't want to make a scene.
