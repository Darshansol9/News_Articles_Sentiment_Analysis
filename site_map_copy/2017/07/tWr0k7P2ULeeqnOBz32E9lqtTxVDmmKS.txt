Story highlights Sensors mounted on gun holsters would activate the body cameraThey would also signal nearby body cameras to start recording(CNN) Police body camera footage can be instrumental when investigating officer-involved shootings. But what happens when an officer does not activate his body camera?A major manufacturer of body cameras is taking steps to address that scenario. Axon, formerly known as Taser International, plans to release new body cameras in late September that start recording automatically the moment a gun leaves its holster.The Axon Signal Sidearm Holster is a device that will "alert all Axon cameras within a 30-foot radius" to start recording. Company spokesman Steve Tuttle said the device has a sensor that mounts to the outside of the holster and detects when the gun is drawn."This technology lets police officers focus on what's important, which is public safety," Tuttle said.
