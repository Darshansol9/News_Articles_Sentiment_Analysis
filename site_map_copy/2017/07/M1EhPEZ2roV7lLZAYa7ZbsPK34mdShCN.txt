Simpson left many people scratching their heads when he told parole commissioners he had lived a "conflict-free life."His former manager, Norman Pardo, downplayed those comments, laughing at them when he appeared Friday on CNN's "New Day." Pardo defended the former football great and celebrated the Nevada parole board's decision Thursday to grant Simpson parole after he served nearly nine years in prison for armed robbery and kidnapping at a Las Vegas hotel in 2007."In O.J.'s world, it's conflict-free," Pardo said before sharing a view echoed by many Simpson supporters: "The main conflict is he is O.J.
