Police reports link Hernandez and several other University of Florida football players to an argument in the parking lot.Hernandez was one of more than 20 people interviewed by police, and he was the only one who did not make a statement after invoking his right to counsel.At the time, Hernandez's mother told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper, "I know he was at the club, but he never saw any shooting."The case remains open, and no one has been charged.Hernandez was also suspended at least once for marijuana, an issue that would follow him as he entered the draft his junior year.A chance to be an NFL starIn 2010, despite his legal problems, Hernandez decided to skip his senior year at Florida and turn pro. Trying to put the alleged drug use behind him, Hernandez wrote a letter to the Patriots director of personnel."If you draft me as a member of the New England Patriots, I will willfully submit to a bi-weekly drug test throughout my rookie season. ... In addition, I will tie any guaranteed portion of my 2010 compensation to these drug tests and reimburse the team a pro-rata amount for any failed drug test," he wrote, according to the Boston Globe.Before the draft, Hernandez was expected to be a first- or second-round pick. He was passed over until the fourth round, when the Patriots selected him.JUST WATCHED Inside the case against Aaron Hernandez Replay More Videos ...
