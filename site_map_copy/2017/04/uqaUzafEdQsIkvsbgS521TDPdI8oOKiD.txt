Story highlights Mountain gorillas are a critically endangered speciesIn the early 1970s, there were only 240 gorillas left in RwandaA 2010 census showed the number of gorillas had doubled(CNN) In 1967, American primatologist Dian Fossey arrived by herself at Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park.She set up camp between two of the park's volcanoes, planning to study the area's critically endangered mountain gorillas.
