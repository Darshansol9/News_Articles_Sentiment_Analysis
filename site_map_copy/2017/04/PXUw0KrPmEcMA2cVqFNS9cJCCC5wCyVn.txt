"Don't talk about Bill O'Reilly and a sexual harassment suit, or suits, when you know nothing about the context and the content of what those suits are.". @DanaBashCNN on @POTUS : Don't talk about Bill O'Reilly's sexual harassment suits when you don't know the context https://t.co/6NtI6GLxnEBash's words came as part of a live discussion with Wolf Blitzer on "Newsroom," during which she suggested past relationships ought not lead to statements of support from the Oval Office."It's nice that he is a loyal friend," said Bash. "But he's the President of the United States, and to say that, no matter how nice he's been, is completely inappropriate."Seated alongside Bash, CNN's Nia-Malika Henderson added some context to the topic of alleged sexual harassment."There's background here. We all remember the 'Access Hollywood' tape and the things he was saying on that tape, and some of the accusations leveled at him," the senior political reporter said of Trump. "He probably should've just passed on this question."Bash later noted that the President's inner-circle likely shuddered when learning of his comments, suggesting his aides "probably got physically nauseous" when they heard him weigh in on the O'Reilly accusations.
