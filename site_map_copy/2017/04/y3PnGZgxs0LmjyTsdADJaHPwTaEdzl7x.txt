Story highlights Pro-Trump talk show host Alex Jones has stirred controversy with his rants and his conspiracy theoriesCNN's Michael Smerconish says while Jones may deem his show "performance art," his audience consider what he says "real"(CNN) Conservative talk show host Alex Jones's ongoing custody battle exemplifies "what has driven American political discourse into a ditch," CNN's Michael Smerconish argued Saturday on his show.Jones, who broadcasts his radio show on 150 stations, as well as on his website Infowars, has stirred controversy and gained notoriety for his furious, ranting style and belief in conspiracy theories.
