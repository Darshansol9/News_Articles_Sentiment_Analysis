(CNN) The wife of the former Tennessee teacher accused of absconding with 15-year-old Elizabeth Thomas wants to end her marriage of 31 years, according to court filings.Jill Cummins, who has pleaded with her husband to bring Elizabeth home, filed the documents last week, citing irreconcilable differences and alleging that Tad Cummins is "guilty of inappropriate marital conduct."Under the Tennessee law that provides 15 grounds for divorce, she selected the section that says, "The husband or wife is guilty of such cruel and inhuman treatment or conduct towards the spouse as renders cohabitation unsafe and improper, which may also be referred to in pleadings as inappropriate marital conduct."Tad Cummins: The 50-year-old has brown hair, brown eyes and a gray goatee. He is 6 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds. He is believed to be armed.Elizabeth Thomas: The 15-year-old has light brown or blond hair and hazel eyes. She is 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 120 pounds. She was last seen wearing a flannel shirt and black leggings.Jill Cummins demands alimony for life, as well as attorney fees. The pair have two children but they're both adults, so there is no mention of child support.It was the first marriage for both, the court documents say."It's difficult, but as we've said she is trying to as much as possible to move forward and move on, not an easy thing to do. And with everything that is swirling around with Tad and Elizabeth, she is understandably wanting to try to remain as private as possible with this process," her attorney, Michael Cox, told CNN in an email.Jill Cummins hired Cox last week to assist in her divorce, the lawyer said.Cummins lists March 13, the day her husband allegedly disappeared with Elizabeth, as the date they separated. She says she's had no contact with him since that day, according to court documents. Cox said he did not have any details regarding their last interaction.The Maury County Chancery Court permitted Jill Cummins to serve her husband with divorce papers via publication in the local newspaper because "defendant cannot be found at his usual place of abode ... and there is just ground to believe he is gone beyond the limits of the state."JUST WATCHED Images of missing student and teacher released Replay More Videos ...
