"Now are concerned about raising their kids here. People aren't jumping to conclusions but (are) wanting to be on their guard."VigilOn Sunday, Kansans, native-born and those who have settled in the state, stood with heads bowed in a vigil for the victim, according to local media. Madasani spoke at the event, sponsored by the India Association of Kansas City at the Ball Conference Center in Olathe."I wish it was a dream," he said, according to the Kansas City Star."What happened that night was a senseless crime and that took away my best friend."Madasani and Kuchibhotla, originally from India, worked at Garmin, the technology company that makes GPS devices.Sunayana Dumala, Kuchibhotla's widow, said she was constantly worried about violence against foreigners in the United States, but her husband had assured her everything would be OK."I told him many times, 'Should we think about going back? Should we think about going to a different country?' He said, 'No,' " she told CNN affiliate KCTV-TV.Indian media: Questions over reaction to killingAn opinion piece in the Hindustan Times, a leading Indian newspaper, questioned the disparity between the coverage of killings of white victims and those of other races, and asked why the incident was not a bigger media story in the US.JUST WATCHED Victim: 'I expected his magazine to be empty' Replay More Videos ...

Kumail Nanjani, a Pakistani-American comic, tweeted: "The President could say "Don't shoot innocent brown people. It's wrong." And he would save lives.

"I don't even know what America is anymore. There is nothing to say. I'm just sorry."Suspect told bartender he was on the runA few hours after he allegedly shot the three, Purinton walked into an Applebee's in neighboring Missouri and opened up to the bartender, according to 911 calls.The suspect told the bartender that he had shot two people in Olathe, Kansas, and was looking for a place to hide, the bartender told dispatchers."So I'm a bartender at Applebee's ... and I had this guy come into my bar and he told me he'd done something really bad and he was on the run from the police," the bartender said in 911 calls released by CNN affiliate KSHB."He said that he shot and killed two ... people in Olathe.
