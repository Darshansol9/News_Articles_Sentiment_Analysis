Many parents brought their children to the event.The parade, held in the Mid-City neighborhood far from the French Quarter, included three dozen tractor-drawn floats, some of them double- and triple-deckers."With 81 floats, 3,200 riders, and a budget of $7 million, Endymion is the largest Mardi Gras parade. It is also the only parade to roll on a route from Mid-City to downtown New Orleans," reported NOLA.com.The annual parade is marked by its massive floats, many decorated with neon lettering, large and glowing fleurs-de-lis, big video screens and even spotlights shooting into the sky.The size of the floats allows hundreds of people to ride on some of them, and the riders -- some dressed in tuxedos, others wearing masks and costumes -- continually toss beads and necklaces to the thick crowd.Mardi Gras , French for "Fat Tuesday," is a day of revelry that includes parades, parties and gastronomic indulgence before the Christian fasting season of Lent begins on Ash Wednesday.
