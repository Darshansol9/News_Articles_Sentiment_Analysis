Murder. Chicago.A gorgeous, historic lakeside city known for its world-class attractions, cultural influence and brilliant exports -- from deep-dish pizza and the world champion Cubbies to Chance the Rapper and Barack Obama -- Chicago should be known for other things.Too often, that's not the case. Yet while Chicago's violence is real and, at times, startling, there are many cities with more disturbing body counts.Over and over, we hear it. It's a premise of Ice Cube's "Barbershop: The Next Cut" and Spike Lee's "Chiraq." Hometown son Kanye West, one of many Chi-town rappers to lament the city's violence, has rhymed, "I'm from the murder capital where they murder for capital."News outlets have handed Chicago unsavory titles like "America's mass shooting capital," and when the city recently went more than six days without a shooting death, local reporters felt it warranted a headline . Plenty of people were shot, mind you, just none fatally.Even President Donald Trump has homed in on the violence whipping through the Windy City.Chicago murder rate is record setting - 4,331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016.
