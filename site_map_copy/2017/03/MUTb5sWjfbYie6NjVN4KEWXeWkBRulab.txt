Capers told reporters.Two of the students -- Nisa Mickens, 15, and Kayla Cuevas, 16 -- were beaten with baseball bats and a machete, Capers said. The girls attended Brentwood High School in Brentwood, a working-class community in Suffolk County, about 45 miles east of New York City.At the time, police said there appeared to be gang involvement in the girls' deaths and the deaths of two others, whose skeletal remains were found after they had been missing for months.
