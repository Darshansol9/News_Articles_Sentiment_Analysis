Health careRepublicans have rolled out their long-awaited bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act , and there is a LOT to unpack.

It would also make changes to things like Medicaid and health savings accounts. People who seem likely to benefit from the new plan are young people, healthy people and the country's highest earners. Older people, those with pre-existing conditions and lower-income Americans may not like it so much.2. ImmigrationOn a related note, Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly told CNN the department is considering separating children from their parents at the border. He said the plan would help combat child exploitation, since currently adults found crossing the border with children are typically allowed to stay in the US.3. North KoreaIt's a mess.
