(CNN) Once again, dozens of Jewish headstones have been vandalized, stoking fears of heightened anti-Semitism. And once again, members of the Muslim community are rallying to help.The latest spate of destruction came over the weekend at Mount Carmel Cemetery in Philadelphia , where 75 to 100 tombstones were toppled. A week earlier, at least 170 headstones were damaged at a Jewish cemetery in St. Louis.Muslim activist Tarek El-Messidi, who had started a fund-raising campaign to help clean up the St. Louis cemetery , sprung to action again after the Philadelphia attack."I want to ask all Muslims to reach out to your Jewish brothers and sisters and stand together against this bigotry," he wrote on Facebook"Last week, our Muslim community raised money for the vandalized Jewish Cemetery in St Louis. Since we raised well above the goal, we can now use extra funds to help here in Philadelphia."As of Wednesday afternoon, the campaign had raised $155,000 -- nearly eight times the original goal of $20,000.El-Messidi said he immediately visited the Philadelphia Jewish cemetery and offered his support after hearing the news.
