Story highlights Federal court affirms that New Orleans can remove Confederate monumentsMonuments had been declared "nuisances" by city council(CNN) New Orleans can remove three Confederate monuments that are displayed in prominent locations, a US federal court ruled on Monday.A lawsuit had been filed by three historic preservation societies and the local chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans seeking to stop the city from removing the statues.But the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected their claims as lacking "legal viability or support."
