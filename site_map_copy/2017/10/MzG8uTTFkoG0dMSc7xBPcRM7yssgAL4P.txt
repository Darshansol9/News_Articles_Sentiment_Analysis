Mike McGuire, who represents the North Bay.There are simply no words to describe the sorrow. Initial damage assessments for unincorporated Sonoma Co are in: 3,819 destroyed parcels, $2.019 Billion. When Santa Rosa is combined, damage estimates top $3 billion.

"Our goal is to get you back in. We're working as a team."He said officials hope to reopen neighborhoods at some point and let residents return using checkpoints and escorts."So, you'll literally be able to show up at this place, say 'this is my home, here is my ID,' and you'll be escorted in to get things," the sheriff said.Ash and debris could be 'very toxic'Health officials warned residents returning home to be careful about sifting through their belongings.The Tubbs Fire destroyed homes in Santa Rosa, California."The ash and the debris is very toxic. You have lots of chemicals and plastic and paint burned down," said Dr. Karen Relucio, public health officer in Napa County.She advised that it could be hot and there could be sharp objects in the debris."We strongly urge you not to remove any large debris because this can release toxins into the air."In Santa Rosa, a city about 50 miles northwest of San Francisco, Penny Wright was one of those who returned.She tearfully walked through the debris of where her home once stood. With burned cars, concrete and twisted metal scattered everywhere, it was hard to tell which one was her house."All your life savings and work for all the years is gone," she said. "We lived here 10 years. I never thought that Santa Rosa would have a fire like this and we would lose everything."
