(CNN) A handwritten note in Stephen Paddock's hotel room contained calculations pertaining to the distance and trajectory from his 32nd-floor window to the crowd of concertgoers he targeted below, according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation.CNN has previously reported that a note containing only numbers was found in the room. Those numbers were characterized as being significant to the gunman.CBS News' "60 Minutes" first reported that Paddock's note contained handwritten calculations.The note was found in the hotel suite at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino among 23 firearms, ammunition and the gunman's dead body. Paddock took his own life, authorities have said, after killing 58 people and wounding nearly 500.Investigators have been combing through evidence left behind and Paddock's background for any hint as to what led the retired accountant to amass an arsenal of high-powered assault rifles, meticulously map out an attack and open fire on the crowd at last weekend's Route 91 Harvest Festival.No sign of motive in sea of tipsAuthorities have no credible information about Paddock's motive despite more than 1,000 leads and tips, Undersheriff Kevin C. McMahill said at a news conference Friday.In the news briefing and an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, McMahill released more details about the shooting and investigation Friday, including:• A Mandalay Bay security guard who authorities believe drew Paddock's attention toward the hallway outside his hotel suite went to that floor to respond to an alarm due to an open door near Paddock's room. The guard, Jesus Campos, was shot in the leg while checking on the alarm. According to a police-reported timeline, Paddock never fired on the crowd below again after that.JUST WATCHED Vegas police investigating if gunman had help Replay More Videos ...

The door was not forced open, had been open for a while and Paddock didn't have the keys to that room. McMahill said that door either had been left open or didn't shut completely.• Investigators looking into Sunday's massacre have found no known nexus to terrorism or connections to ISIS.• Authorities are confident there was not another shooter in Paddock's room but are still trying to determine whether anyone else knew of his plans.• Authorities do not believe another person used Paddock's room key at the Mandalay Bay hotel.• Investigators have reviewed "voluminous amounts of video" from different locations, including Mandalay Bay, and have not seen any other person they think at this point is another suspect.• Asked about video on which Paddock might have discussed motive, McMahill said: "I am not aware that we have recovered any such video."• Police don't know what the killer was going to do with 50 pounds of explosives found in his car.• Paddock brought the 23 guns and ammunition he had in his hotel suite over the course of several days, the undersheriff told CNN.• Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley, continues to cooperate with investigators, her lawyer and McMahill each said Friday. Attorney Matthew Lombard said Danley wouldn't be making any more public statements in the near future.Pence honors massacre victimsVice President Mike Pence offered prayers and words of comfort for Las Vegas on Saturday, as he and his wife participated in a citywide "unity prayer walk" in honor of the shooting victims."We are with you today. Today we are all Vegas strong," Pence told participants gathered at City Hall. "President Trump personally asked us to be here to stand with you, to pray with you, for strength, comfort and healing."The President visited Las Vegas on Wednesday. Like Trump, Pence praised first responders, saying, "Their actions undoubtedly saved lives that night.""We find hope in the heroic actions in the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, the fire department and all the first responders on that night who, without regard for their personal safety, rushed into harm's way," Pence said.The vice president called the shooting "a tragedy of unimaginable proportions" and said, "Las Vegas came face to face with pure evil" that night.Request to seize shooter's assetsThe family of one of the concertgoers killed last weekend is asking a Nevada court to appoint a special administrator to take control of the shooter's assets.John Phippen , 56, of Santa Clarita, California, was at the festival with his son Travis when the shooting started. When the son, a medic, stopped to help someone, Phippen stayed with him and was shielding a woman when he was shot dead, said a neighbor, Leah Nagiyvanyi.Attorneys for Phippen's family filed the petition Friday in District Court in Clark County. The petition asks a judge to appoint the county's public administrator to account for and control Paddock's estate -- in part to make it available for any future lawsuits filed by the shooting victims.Paddock, a gambler and retired accountant, owned a home in Mesquite, Nevada, and his brother has said he was a successful real estate investor who owned apartments and houses. Sales agents told CNN that Paddock paid $369,022 in cash for his Mesquite home in 2014.The court "will notify (Paddock's) family members, and we'll see where this goes," said Richard A. Patterson, a California attorney representing Phippen's son Travis."We want (Paddock's estate) administered by the court. I don't think we're at the bottom of (Paddock's assets)," Patterson said."We want someone to oversee the assets so it stays the way it is," said Nevada-based probate attorney Richard Chatwin, who is working with Patterson on the petition.Source: Shooter tried to buy tracer roundsPaddock tried to buy tracer ammunition at a gun show in the Phoenix area in recent weeks, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN.Paddock bought other ammunition at the show, but he couldn't obtain the tracer ammunition -- bullets with a pyrotechnic charge that, when the round is fired, leaves an illuminated trace of its path -- because the vendor didn't have any to sell, the official said.Paddock did not use tracer bullets when he fired into the festival crowd hundreds of yards away.The official explained that if Paddock had tracer ammunition, he could have had a more precise idea of where his shots were going in the darkness, and could have been more accurate.Shooters wanting greater accuracy often mix tracer rounds with non-tracers -- perhaps having one tracer every fifth round in a magazine, said Art Roderick, a CNN law enforcement analyst."It allows you to keep your weapon on not necessarily a specific target, but a specific area. ... There would have been a lot higher casualty rate if he had tracer rounds," said Roderick, a former assistant director of the US Marshals Service.JUST WATCHED New video shows concertgoers fleeing scene Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH What we know about the Las Vegas gunman 01:41In addition to the weapons in his hotel suite, Paddock had more than 50 pounds of exploding targets and 1,600 rounds of ammunition in his car in the hotel parking lot, police said, fueling suspicion he intended to survive the massacre.McMahill said Friday there was no evidence that Paddock intended to use the target material for a homemade bomb.Escape, in this case, might have meant using the equipment in the car for further assaults until he got caught, said John Sheahan, a former Las Vegas SWAT team member."There's one of three ways it's going to end for an active shooter, and they pretty much all know this. You're either going to commit suicide; you're going to ... shoot it out with (police) and you're going to be killed, or you're going to continue on a preplanned rampage at locations B, C, D and E until the police finally stop you," Sheahan said."He rented the room in his own name. He's already on video coming in and out. We know who he is. He's going to be the most wanted man in the world if he does try to leave here," he added.
