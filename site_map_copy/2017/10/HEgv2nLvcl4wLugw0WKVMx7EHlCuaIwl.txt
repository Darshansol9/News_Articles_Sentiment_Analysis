They will be joined by mounted officers on horseback as well as Florida Highway Patrol troopers, according to a release from the city."We want those families in southeast Seminole Heights and those kids in particular to be able to go out and have a normal, safe Halloween," Buckhorn told CNN's sister network HLN on Monday.

The vast majority are related to the video, said Stephen Hegarty, spokesman for the Tampa Police Department.Any clue, any little detail such as the phone flip, may lead to a break in the case, authorities said."There are some distinctive things about that person that we're hoping people will watch and will jog memories," Buckhorn told HLN's Erica Hill.Earlier in the month, police had released another surveillance video of the same person walking in the area.Police are asking for clues on the person in this surveillance video.Effect on neighborhoodThe killings have alarmed residents in Seminole Heights."It could've been any of us walking down the street with our dog or walking around to the corner store," said Tammy Brooks, a resident told CNN affiliate WFLAFeeling uneasy about walking in the dark, Brooks considered taking her daughter to another neighborhood for trick-or-treating."It was heartbreaking, yes, to feel like you can't come out or do what we used to do," she said.After hearing that the police would boost its presence in the neighborhood, Brooks said she felt more comfortable about staying close to home.The mayor acknowledged that many people are fearful."They're under siege as a result of the senseless killings of these three innocent people," Buckhorn said. "We want to compliment that neighborhood for standing up and not being willing to surrender, not being cowed, not staying in their houses. They're out there with us. They recognize that they have to use precaution... but they're not giving up."
