There also were books and notes on making explosives, and a handwritten note that ended, "I shall have my bloody revenge, and then the WORLD WILL BURN BURN."Drake, 24, was arrested and charged Wednesday with two counts of unlawfully making, possessing or attempting to make a destructive device. The child pornography he was suspected of distributing has not been found, said Gualtieri, without elaborating on that investigation. Drake's computers were seized.On Thursday evening, Drake was released on $20,000 but was held under Florida's Baker Act -- which allows mental health facilities to hold a person for up to 72 hours for evaluation, according to county officials.Read More
