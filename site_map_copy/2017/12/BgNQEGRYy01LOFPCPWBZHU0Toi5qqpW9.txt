"Once this storm moves off the coast, it will have blanketed a swath of snow stretching roughly 2,000 miles from the Deep South to the New England coast."Snow began falling Saturday morning in Washington, then up to New York City and through the Northeast. The storm's impact varied along the path, with Washington and New York having under 3 inches of snow, while Boston and Philadelphia saw more than 4 inches, according to the National Weather Service.#snowing #centralpark A post shared by Colleen Martin (@colleenmartin31) on Dec 9, 2017 at 8:22am PSTThe storm is expected to drop an additional 1-2 inches of snow in Boston and 2-4 inches in Maine on Sunday, Van Dam said.
