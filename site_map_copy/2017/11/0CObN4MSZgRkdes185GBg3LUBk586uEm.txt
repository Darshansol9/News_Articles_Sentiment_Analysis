"You cannot be victorious in battle without being wounded in battle."Pomeroy and his wife, Sherri, were out of town last Sunday when their daughter was killed."I know everyone who lost their life that day, some of which were my best friends, and my daughter," Pomeroy said, overcome with emotion as he spoke.

God gets the glory."Worshippers gather in front of a roadside memorial to sing praises & honor the #SutherlandSpringsShooting victims hours after church let out pic.twitter.com/rPzJMqNNbD â€” Jaide Garcia (@Jaide_Garcia) November 12, 2017Read More
