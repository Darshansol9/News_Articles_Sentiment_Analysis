You'll get another chance Tuesday about 45 minutes before sunrise. One caveat: They won't be as close to each other.The phenomenon is called a conjunction. It's not uncommon, but it's rare to see them so close. "The planets will appear to move past each other forming what looks like a brilliant double star," NASA said in a video touting the eventIn southeastern Spain, Néstor Mateos Ramos filmed the planets for 7 minutes and then sped up the video to show their path through the sky.Photographer Irv Bartlett got these photos of the planets over the Palace Pier in Brighton, United Kingdom.Astronomy photographer Alan Dyer was also up before dawn to see the conjunction over southeastern Alberta, Canada.#Venus and #Jupiter in close #conjunction this morning (Nov 13) at dawn, low in the southeast below Mars and the waning Moon, from southern Alberta. @twanight pic.twitter.com/m0f5WIeESN — Alan Dyer (@amazingskyguy) November 13, 2017Because the two planets are so bright, you can see the display with your naked eye -- but you do need to be careful not to stare into the sun as it rises.If you're a stargazer or astrophotographer, we'd like to hear from you.
