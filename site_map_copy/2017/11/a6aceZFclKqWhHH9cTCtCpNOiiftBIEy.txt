(CNN) Was this a brutal attack or an unfortunate fall?More than a week after border patrol agent Rogelio Martinez was mortally wounded -- and days after his burial -- Martinez's family still has no idea how he died.Several officials have called the west Texas incident an "attack" or "ambush." President Donald Trump cited it as a reason to build his border wall.Culberson County Sheriff Oscar Carrillo told CNN he arrived at the scene and helped attend to Martinez, who was alive at that point and in the culvert. He said the scene didn't look like one of an attack or ambush, and to suggest so, as some people have, is "very premature."Carrillo had earlier told The Dallas Morning News the injuries may be consistent with a fall into the culvert where Martinez and his partner were found.Here's what we know about Martinez's last night of patrol -- and the conflicting narratives about what happened.What we knowJUST WATCHED FBI details Border Patrol agents' injuries Replay More Videos ...
