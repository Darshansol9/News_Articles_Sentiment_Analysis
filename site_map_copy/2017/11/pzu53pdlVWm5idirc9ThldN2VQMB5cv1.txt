3. Submarine searchThe search for a missing Argentine sub carrying 44 crew members continues, and the latest news isn't good. The Argentine navy says a noise detected near the last known location of the sub on the day it vanished was consistent with an explosion. A spokesman called the sound "an anomalous, singular, short, violent and non-nuclear event." Teams from a dozen nations have been searching by air and sea for the ARA San Juan, which was last contacted off the coast of Argentina on November 15. Experts say the sub has enough air to last seven to 10 days, if it remains fully underwater.4. Oscar PistoriusA South African high court more than doubled the prison sentence of Oscar Pistorius , the former Olympic and Paralympic sprinter who was charged with murder after shooting and killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in 2013. Pistorious previously was sentenced to six years in prison for the murder, which he says was an accident after he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder. Prosecutors argued the punishment was too lenient, and this new ruling increases Pistorius' sentence to 13 years and five months. Steenkamp's family says she "can now rest in peace" after a more appropriate allotment of justice has been served.
