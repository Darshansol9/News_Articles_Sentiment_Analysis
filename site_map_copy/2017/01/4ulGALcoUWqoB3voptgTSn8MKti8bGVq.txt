Boasberg's decision effectively delays the final portion of the pipeline from being built.Last month, the Army said it will not let the pipeline cross the federally administered reservoir on the Missouri River because the decision requires more analysis, including a deeper consideration of alternative routes, Assistant Secretary of the Army Jo-Ellen Darcy wroteIn her letter to the commander of the Army Corps of Engineers, she noted that the proposed route under Lake Oahe would be 0.5 miles upstream from the northern border of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation."The Tribe relies on Lake Oahe for drinking water and irrigation ... and the Tribe retains water, hunting and fishing rights in the lake," Darcy wrote.The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe applauded the news that the environmental study will proceed."We appreciate the time and effort it took to get us to this point; yet another small victory on the path to justice," the tribe said in a statement."It is, however, still not over. We still need your support. While the EIS (environmental impact study) is exactly what we called for, the final product must be stronger and more broad in scope."Protests at confirmation hearing for EPA nomineeWhile protesters have celebrated a pair of small victories in the past month, there's a lingering concern that the new Trump administration will oppose their efforts.JUST WATCHED Protesters stand strong despite blizzard Replay More Videos ...
