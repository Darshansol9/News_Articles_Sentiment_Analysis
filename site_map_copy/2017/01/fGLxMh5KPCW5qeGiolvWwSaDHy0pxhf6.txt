Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) Two of the three charges against Fort Lauderdale airport shooting suspect Esteban Santiago carry the possibility of the death penalty, a federal magistrate judge told Santiago on Monday.The charges handed down are using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence; performing an act of violence against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation that caused serious bodily injury; and causing the death of a person through the use of a firearm.The latter two are punishable by death, while the first charge carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.Authorities claim Santiago has confessed to the Friday mass shooting at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport that left five people dead.Santiago, 26, entered the court in a red prison jumpsuit and sat down. He kept his head down throughout his first court appearance. He told US Magistrate Judge Alicia O. Valle that he understood his rights before explaining he was not employed and had served in the Army for about 10 years.He owns no car or property, he said, and has only $5 or $10 in his bank account.Valle appointed Santiago a lawyer. His next court date is January 17, and his arraignment is slated for January 23.Since the shooting, details about the attack, the victims and how the suspect may have "slipped through the cracks" have emerged. Here's what we know:The suspect's background and travelsSuspect Esteban Santiago is being held in federal custody in Florida.-- Santiago, a security guard living in Alaska, had served in the US Army Reserve and the Alaska Army National Guard. He completed a 10-month tour of Iraq from 2010 to 2011.-- After his time in Iraq, his aunt and brother said, he came back a changed man -- hearing voices or having "visions all the time."-- Santiago recently began selling his possessions, including his car. Friends and associates noticed more erratic behavior, investigators have learned from interviews with those who know him.This composite photo shows views of the room where Esteban Santiago was living in Anchorage.-- The suspect rented a small room at Qupqugiaq Inn, an Anchorage motel. The FBI searched the room on Friday night.-- Two months ago, Santiago voluntarily went into the Anchorage FBI office and said his mind was being controlled by US intelligence. He was "having terroristic thoughts and believed he was influenced by ISIS," Anchorage police said.-- At that time, authorities took away his gun and ordered a mental health evaluation. But he was not deemed mentally defective, so authorities later gave him back his gun . Sources say it was the same gun Santiago used in Friday's rampage.JUST WATCHED Suspect's brother: 'He was a peaceful person' Replay More Videos ...

But Karen Loeffler, the US Attorney for the District of Alaska, said she thinks "law enforcement acted within the laws that they have."-- Santiago told investigators he bought a one-way ticket from Anchorage to Fort Lauderdale and brought a Walther 9-millimeter pistol and two magazines.-- A lieutenant with the Anchorage airport police said Santiago had one checked bag -- a handgun case containing a pistol.-- Though authorities do not yet know Santiago's motive, the FBI has not ruled out terrorism.-- The day before the shooting, Santiago spoke to a sibling in Florida and told him he wanted to visit, but Santiago didn't say he planned to take a flight the next day, according to another sibling, Bryan Santiago, who lives in Puerto Rico. Bryan Santiago said he also didn't know his brother would be traveling to Florida on Friday.Video of shooting releasedJUST WATCHED When the gunman opened fire Replay More Videos ...
