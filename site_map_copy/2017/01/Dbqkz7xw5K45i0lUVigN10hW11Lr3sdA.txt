(CNN) The Southeast picked up the pieces on Monday after deadly tornadoes tore through the region, killing more people in one weekend than in all of last year, and officials called out for the federal government to urgently help their devastated communities.At least 41 reported twisters ravaged the Southern states over the weekend, killing 19 people and destroying homes, CNN meteorologists reported. At least six people were believed to be missing in Georgia, including a 2-year-old boy who was caught in the tornado in Dougherty County, officials said.Tornadoes were reported in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina. In 2016, tornadoes left 17 people dead across the country.Three weather-related deaths also were reported in California and one person died in Pennsylvania, increasing the total nationwide to 23.Chris Cohilas, the chairman of the Dougherty County Commission in southwestern Georgia, said storms slammed his county early this month and these latest twisters compounded the agony.He implored the Federal Emergency Management Agency to get "boots on the ground" to help the community since the storms on January 2 and warnings of more to come. So far, he said, FEMA has not been responsive and he aired his frustrations with the agency."To get caught up in the bureaucratic red tape at a time of this amount of human suffering is disgraceful," he said at a news conference on Monday."I would ask that President Trump take some significant steps to cut through the bureaucratic red tape and to get us some people on the damn ground."In an email, FEMA said the agency "is doing initial assessments of damages in Georgia today, including a flyover." At the request of Georgia officials, FEMA will start federal and state preliminary damage assessments for individual and public assistance this week, the agency said.FEMA representatives were also recently deployed to emergency centers in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia and Florida to support the response, and teams are on standby if needed, officials said.Piercing screamsThe barreling twisters left people stunned and communities devastated. They remindedone survivor in Georgia of a scene from a horror movie."All you hear is people screaming, 'Help me, help me,' " said AJ Miley, a resident of the Sunshine Mobile Home Park in Georgia, according to CNN affiliate WSB-TV.Devocheo Williams, also at the trailer park, said he saw people "tossed through the air," the TV station reported"All I saw was a little girl flown up and thrown in a ditch. Three seconds later, the trailer got picked up off the ground and landed on top of the mother and son," Williams said.When the howling winds subsided, the landscape across the Southeast was dotted with overturned cars, debris and scores of damaged mobile homes.JUST WATCHED Deadly storms destroy Georgia mobile homes Replay More Videos ...
