(CNN) Nearly two years after Freddie Gray's death in police custody led to protests, Baltimore and the US Justice Department agreed to terms Thursday on sweeping police reforms that include cameras in all police transport vans.The 227-page consent decree comes after the Justice Department monitored Baltimore's policing methods for more than a year after the 2015 death of Gray, who suffered a fatal injury while being transported in a police van."We now require cameras in those vans," Mayor Catherine Pugh said."We want to make sure that individuals are transported singularly and that they're strapped into those vans correctly and that people are not harmed in that process."But the troubled police department's problems went beyond its transport of prisoners.The decree also mandates community oversight; new recruitment policies; additional training on stops, searches and arrests; an emphasis on "de-escalation, using tactics that defuse incidents"; and sexual assault investigations that promote "victim-centered, trauma-informed approach and combat gender bias.""Through this agreement, we are moving forward together to heal the tension in the relationship between (the police department) and the community it serves," Attorney General Loretta Lynch said at a news conference, flanked by the mayor and Police Commissioner Kevin Davis."We have no illusions that the change we seek will be easy," Lynch added. "It will require a great deal of work from the leadership and officers of the Baltimore Police Department. It will require persistent feedback and input from community members."The decree was filed in federal court, and -- after the expected approval by a judge -- a period of community input will be followed by the selection of a monitor to oversee the police department."We have come a long, long way," said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.From Freddie Gray to a consent decree The Justice Department began investigating Baltimore police practices less than a month after the death of Freddie Gray. Here is a timeline of the case and the probe. April 2015: Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man, suffers a broken neck in a prisoner transport van and dies a week later. His death becomes a symbol of the black community's mistrust of police and triggers days of protest and riots. May 1, 2015: Six police officers are charged in connection with Gray's death, including one who drove the transport van. May 8, 2015: The Justice Department announces it has opened an investigation into whether the Baltimore Police Department engages in a pattern or practice of discriminatory policing. Fall 2015: Some officers start wearing body cameras in a pilot program. December 2015-July 2016: A jury deadlocks in the case against one officer in the Gray case, and three other officers -- including the van driver -- are acquitted. March 2016: The city announces some officers will start wearing body cameras permanently in the spring, and all officers are to wear them by 2018. May 2016: The police department says it has outfitted some prisoner transport vans with cameras that will record activity in the custody compartments. June 2016: Police announce an overhaul of their use-of-force policy. July 27, 2016: Charges against the three remaining officers in the Gray case are dropped. August 2016: The DOJ finds the BPD disproportionately stopped, searched and arrested African-Americans, and used excessive force against juveniles and people with mental health disabilities, over at least a six-year period. Here are some of the most egregious examples cited in the report. January 2017: The federal government and Baltimore agree to terms on sweeping police reforms, including some that the city already has undertaken.The announcement follows a scathing Justice Department report in August that said the unconstitutional practices of some of the city's 2,600 officers led to disproportionate rates of stops, searches and arrests of black residents, and excessive use of force against juveniles and those with mental health disabilities.The report, which covered data from 2010 to 2016, attributed the practices to "systemic deficiencies" in training, policies and accountability structures that "fail to equip officers with the tools they need to police effectively."Gray's death touched off protests and riots in Baltimore and other cities and fueled a debate over racial bias in policing that drew federal scrutiny.JUST WATCHED Senate questions Trump's attorney general pick Replay More Videos ...

Jeff Sessions, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to head the Justice Department and days before Lynch steps down.Sessions' record has raised eyebrows with rights organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union, which considers the senator from Alabama "hostile to consent decrees."The ACLU cites a forward that Sessions wrote for a 2008 report published by Alabama Policy Institute in which he states: "One of the most dangerous, and rarely discussed, exercises of raw power is the issuance of expansive court decrees. Consent decrees have a profound effect on our legal system as they constitute an end run around the democratic process."Session's skepticism on police reform is in sharp contrast to the Lynch's Justice Department under the Obama administration.The department's Civil Rights Division has investigated 25 law enforcement agencies over civil rights abuses during the past seven years; 14 investigations have ended in consent decrees. The department is enforcing an additional 19 agreements with law enforcement agencies.JUST WATCHED Lynch announces Justice Department investigation of Baltimore police Replay More Videos ...

Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, asked the attorney general nominee whether he would commit to maintaining and enforcing consent decrees. He responded that a decree isn't "necessarily a bad thing" but said he remained wary of lawsuits against police departments."I think there is concern that good police officers and good departments can be sued by the Department of Justice when you just have individuals within a department that have done wrong," Sessions said."These lawsuits undermine the respect for police officers and create an impression that the entire department is not doing their work consistent with fidelity to law and fairness, and we need to be careful before we do that."Sen. Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina, followed by asking Sessions whether the Justice Department would help if cities asked for assistance. The nominee said, if asked, it should help."I think it's a good thing that police departments might call on federal investigators," Sessions said.Yet he cautioned against undermining police departments."It really is important that people trust police departments and the police departments have respect from their communities, and when you don't have that, people's safety is at risk." Sessions said.Chicago investigationBesides Baltimore, police departments in Ville Platte, Louisiana, and Chicago have also been under the Justice Department's radar.The department soon is expected to release the results of an investigation into Chicago police.Known as a "pattern and practice" inquiry, it's expected to focus on use of force, deadly force accountability and how the Chicago force "tracks and treats" those incidents, Lynch said when she announced the investigation in December 2015.In an unrelated news conference Wednesday, the attorney general said she couldn't comment on when the Chicago report would be released but said Justice Department officials have been working "very diligently" with the city and police department."We do intend to push through and ... give the city of Chicago, both law enforcement and the communities, the help that they deserve so that they can in fact work on this issues," Lynch said.
