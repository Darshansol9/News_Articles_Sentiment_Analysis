(CNN) In April 2016, when Facebook Live was presented to the masses, there was an immediacy -- and an ironic intimacy -- to the platform. On one side of the screen, you could reveal the smallest details of your life as they unfolded, while on the other side, millions could watch.Armed with this technology, we immediately lurched towards the absurd. Buzzfeed exploded a watermelon, and 800,000 people tuned in. In May, millions of people watched a woman in a Chewbacca mask laughing uncontrollably in a Kohl's parking lot.But in the months following Facebook Live's debut, the pendulum swung sharply from silly viral stuff to serious subjects like police shootings and terrorism. Some live broadcasts became tools of activists and criminals, of the very best and worst of us.Now, in the first week of 2017, a video showing a group of teens torturing a young man became the platform's latest broadcast of horror.It only took a few months for Facebook Live, which offers a vast audience of 1.8 billion monthly active users , to go from exploding watermelons to torture videos. How did we get here?These were some pivotal and shocking moments that have helped define the fledgling platform.April 2016: An exploding watermelonFacebook Live actually launched in limited form in August 2015 as a way for the site's biggest users (celebrities and other influencers) to connect directly with their audience.

One of Facebook Live's first big wins was Buzzfeed's 45-minute broadcast of two people stretching dozens of rubber bands around a watermelon until it burst.May 2016: A baby's birthWith any new technology, there are some growing pains. And sometimes, there are labor pains . A California man accidentially live-streamed his son's birth , allegedly thinking he was just recording it to show later.

Law enforcement shared disturbing pictures and videos from overdoses, and one father even filmed his son's reaction when he learned his mother had died from an overdose.On Facebook Live, one of the most shocking overdose videos wasn't shared with such a serious purpose. It showed a man and a woman unresponsive and splayed out on the grass in Memphis, Tennessee. The person filming the video -- which garnered more than 3 million views -- laughs and makes fun of the catatonic couple, who are clearly in the thralls of an overdose.Ronald Hiers, the man in the video, told CNN that seeing his overdose broadcast to the world was the lowest point in his life.

One particularly sobering detail is that the young woman who is filming the torture also turns the camera on herself, apparently aware that what she is filming will be seen and that her "fans" will willingly watch and comment on the scene in front of her.This leads to one of the biggest questions about the future of Facebook Live: Does it embolden people to act out for an audience?In the case of the Chewbacca mom or the exploding melon, the platform demonstrates its value as a showcase for affecting personal stories or entertaining gags. But in the hands of people with more insidious goals, it's also becoming something far more dangerous.
