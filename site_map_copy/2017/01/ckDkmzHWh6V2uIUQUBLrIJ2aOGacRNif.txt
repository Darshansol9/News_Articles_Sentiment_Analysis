Today we say bye to Barack and we look forward to Trump's tomorrow. Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door .1. Barack ObamaToday's the last full day of the Obama administration , and while that may fill you with either great sadness or great joy, you have to admit this was a historic presidency. Yes, he was the first black president, but his legacy will go far beyond that.He pulled the nation out of a great recessionHis signature domestic achievement -- Obamacare -- may be in grave danger, but what it's replaced with will still contain many elements of his vision for health careHe stood up for the rights of the LGBT communityHe sounded the alarm on climate changeHe offered a different perspective in the nation's long-running conversation on raceAnd he gave the order to kill Osama bin Laden2. Italy avalancheMany people are feared dead after an avalanche buried a hotel in central Italy, following a series of earthquakes. As many as 30 people are trapped inside Hotel Rigopiano, which is in an area popular with skiers. When rescuers reached the hotel, only its top floor and roof could be seen through the snow. And the weather's not cooperating either -- blizzards and strong winds are slowing rescue efforts. Central Italy was hit with more than 10 quakes, four of them stronger than magnitude 5.3. Climate change4. GambiaWhile America's peaceful transfer of power plays out in Washington this week, the exact opposite is happening in Gambia. There, Yahya Jammeh has held sway since a military coup in 1994. But last month, voters finally booted him out. Initially, Jammeh conceded defeat and said he'll step down. But just a week later, he said, 'You know what? I changed my mind.' So, now Gambia has 2 presidents. The real, elected one - Adama Barrow - was due to take power today. But Jammeh isn't budging. So troops from other West African are massed on the border, ready to come in and and push him out.5. PrimatesHere's one more thing to worry about. You can add primates to the seemingly ever-growing list of animals facing extinction. A new report says 60% of all primates are at risk of dying out. SIXTY PERCENT! Who's to blame for this? Us, of course. We're hunting them, trading them and destroying their habitats.BREAKFAST BROWSEPeople are talking about these. Read up.
