Some have photos or signed messages from friends and family, WGN reports.They all rest in a grassy lot in Chicago's Englewood neighborhood, which is quickly filling up."This is going to look very crowded by the time we're done," Zanis told WGN.He built more than 700 crosses in 2016 as Chicago dealt with the deadliest year of gun violence in 20 years .
