Story highlights Site produced plutonium for atomic bombs and uranium metal fuel for nuclear reactorsGovernment has spent billions trying to clean up the contaminated site(CNN) A 20-foot hole in the roof of a tunnel at Washington state's Hanford nuclear waste site will be filled with clean soil, according to the US Department of Energy.Workers noticed that a section of the tunnel had caved in Tuesday morning.
