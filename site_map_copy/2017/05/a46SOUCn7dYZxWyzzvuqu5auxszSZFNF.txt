Burnim said."One of our graduates, in the prime of his life, has fallen victim to an unprovoked assault in yet one more manifestation of the senseless violence permeating our society."The president called for a moment of silence and asked the graduates to contemplate "what each of us might do to promote greater peace, harmony and love that seems to be so lacking in our country, in our world today."Collins was later posthumously awarded his bachelor's degree.

"It was then that (the suspect) stabbed the victim in his chest."Urbanski has been charged with first- and second-degree murder as well as first-degree assault. His attorney, William C. Brennan Jr., said at a bond hearing Monday that his client was intoxicated at the time.But Maryland District Judge Patrice E. Lewis denied bond for Urbanski, calling him "an absolute danger to the community."'Alt-Reich' group now offlineThe police chief said Urbanski was a member of the "Alt-Reich" Facebook group.JUST WATCHED What is the alt-right movement?

Alsobrooks said authorities "need something probably more than just a Facebook posting" for the killing to be considered a hate crime.While investigators try to determine whether Urbanski should be charged with a hate crime, one fact is already apparent, the prosecutor said: Collins was "a person who represented in every way possible the very best of this community.""He was already a person who had accomplished so much," she said, "more than many of us will accomplish in a whole lifetime."
