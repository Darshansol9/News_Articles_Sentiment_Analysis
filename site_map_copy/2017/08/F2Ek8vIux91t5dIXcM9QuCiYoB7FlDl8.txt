By 6:30 a.m. Sunday, inmates from all three units had been placed in facilities in east Texas, spokesman Robert Hurst said.The inmates cannot have visits at their temporary quarters, but they will be able to use the phone. Additional food and water has been delivered to the receiving units, and extra staff has been called in.At this point, the department does not plan to move more inmates, Hurst said.Read More
