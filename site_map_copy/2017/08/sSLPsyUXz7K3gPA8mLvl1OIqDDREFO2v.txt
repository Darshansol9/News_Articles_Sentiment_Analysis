US District Court Judge Susan Bolton handed down her verdict in court papers signed on Monday.Bolton wrote that Arpaio knew of the court order and what it meant for his department's policy of detaining immigrants to turn them over to federal immigration authorities. But the evidence showed "a flagrant disregard" for the order, Bolton wrote."Not only did defendant abdicate responsibility, he announced to the world and to his subordinates that he was going to continue business as usual no matter who said otherwise," Bolton wrote.Arpaio has contended the order wasn't clear and he didn't intend to violate it. Arpaio's defense attorney has argued that Arpaio's former attorney "dropped the ball" and didn't clearly explain the order or seek clarification from the federal judge who issued it.
