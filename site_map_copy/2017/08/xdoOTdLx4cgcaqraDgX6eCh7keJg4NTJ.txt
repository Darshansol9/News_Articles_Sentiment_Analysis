Charlottesville attackIn many minds, what happened in Charlottesville over the weekend is a terror attack. A man drove a car through a crowd of counter-protesters at a rally by white supremacists . A Justice Department official says the feds have gathered enough evidence to suspect the attacker didn't just want to harm the immediate victims but send a message.So why is it so hard for the leader of the free world -- who is usually so quick to tweet at the smallest outrage -- to call out the white supremacists and Nazis by name? President Trump condemned the rally but then blamed it on "many sides ." Remember, one side was there -- chanting and hurling epithets at every minority group - gays, women, African Americans, Jews -- and calling for racial purity. The other wasn't. Both Republicans and Dems alike ripped the President.Trump's allies spent the rest of the weekend doing clean up , with Vice President Mike Pence saying the country had "zero tolerance for hate." Someone else at the White House said it was obvious that Trump condemned those groups. But that official wouldn't say it on the record. Trump's Twitter feed has been silent on the violence since Saturday night.
