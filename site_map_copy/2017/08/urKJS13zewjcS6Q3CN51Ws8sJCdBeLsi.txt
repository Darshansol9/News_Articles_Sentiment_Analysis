"The 30 aliens are now in Border Patrol custody pending further questioning."CPB said the group consisted of 23 Chinese and seven Mexican nationals."While subterranean tunnels are not a new occurrence along the California-Mexico border, they are more commonly utilized by transnational criminal organizations to smuggle narcotics.
