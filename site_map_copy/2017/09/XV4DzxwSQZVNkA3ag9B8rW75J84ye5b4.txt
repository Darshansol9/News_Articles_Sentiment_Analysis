(CNN) Country singer Kenny Chesney said Tuesday that he was heartbroken after seeing the devastation wrought by Hurricane Irma.The Category 5 storm tore through the Caribbean last week, killing at least 38 people and destroying buildings -- including the singer's home on the US Virgin Island of St. John."It's hard to put it into words, because I have got so many memories, so many friends there, so many fabrics and pieces of my life on that island," Chesney told CNN's Anderson Cooper on "AC360."

They survived and, with Chesney's help, were able to evacuate the island.Kate Hanna lost her home to Irma and rode out the storm in Chesney's home.Read More
