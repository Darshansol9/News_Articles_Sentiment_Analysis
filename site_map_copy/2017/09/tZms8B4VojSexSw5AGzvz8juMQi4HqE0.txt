(CNN) In the months since last November's election, the Merriam-Webster dictionary has been on overdrive.It's transformed itself into a cheeky, fact-checking machine . And in the process, it's struck social gold (more than half a million Twitter followers and counting).On Monday, the dictionary released more than 250 new words and definitions. True to its fresh image, the list includes several words that, in this new political and social climate, have taken on a different meaning.Consider "troll."Originally, it was a noun used to describe a dwarf or giant in Scandinavian folklore. The new definition that Merriam-Webster added is a verb: " to antagonize (others) online by deliberately posting inflammatory, irrelevant, or offensive comments or other disruptive content ."
