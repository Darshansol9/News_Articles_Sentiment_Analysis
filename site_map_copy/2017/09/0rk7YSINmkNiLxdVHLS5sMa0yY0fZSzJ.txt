HURRICANE IRMAWhere it is nowOne of the strongest storms to ever hit the US, Irma weakened to a Category 1 overnight. But it's still dangerous. Early this morning, the eye of the storm was about 60 miles north of Tampa, with sustained winds of about 75 mph and wind gusts up to 90 mph. This means, Most of the state will continue to feel Irma's effects -- windy conditions and torrential downpours.Where it is goingIrma's moving northwest through the western part of the Florida peninsula and into the southeastern US. So, later today, parts of Georgia and Alabama will be battered by Irma's strong winds and heavy rains. Irma will weaken to a tropical storm this morning and to a tropical depression by this afternoon. Many schools in Alabama and Georgia have already canceled classes today and tomorrow.Where it has beenAfter wreaking havoc in the Caribbean (and killing at least 26 people there ), Irma slammed into the Florida Keys as a monstrous Category 4 hurricane.
