(CNN) The US mainland should not breathe a sigh of relief just yet despite early forecasts that Hurricane Maria will remain out to sea.The storm is a Category 3 hurricane packing winds of 115 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center.The current forecast does not show a direct hit on the East Coast, forecasters say, but such a path cannot be ruled out this far in advance.Moving away from Puerto Rico, it's bringing high winds and heavy rain to the northern coast of the Dominican Republic, the hurricane center said.But tracking models are good for three to five days, and anything beyond that is hard to forecast, according to CNN meteorologist Michael Guy.A five-day span shows Maria meandering off the US East Coast, but it's unclear what happens afterward, he said.Whether the eye of the storm will hit the East Coast is a waiting game, he said. And even if it does not make landfall, the East Coast will be affected in some way."Most likely it will bring a chance of rain to the Mid-Atlantic up through Massachusetts depending on how close it gets to the coast," Guy said.JUST WATCHED Hurricane Maria leaves trail of devastation Replay More Videos ...

At the same time, Jose has spurred a tropical storm warning for parts of coastal Massachusetts , and high surf and rip currents are possible along the East Coast.The long-range forecast shows Maria will push Jose out of the way and fill up the space it leaves in between the two highs while meandering off the US East Coast, Guy said.But the storm and elements in the atmosphere could change and steer things differently, he said.Hurricane Maria showed no mercy when it barreled through Dominica , killing at least 15 people.The Caribbean island nation of 73,000 residents is known for its lush greenery, punctuated by waterfalls and rain forests. But nearly two days after Maria made landfall, an aerial survey showed trees snapped and strewn across the landscape, and the island stripped of vegetation.The rain forests appear to have vanished, with roofs torn away, homes ripped open and debris littering areas like confetti.Restoring power could take months, Gov. Ricardo Rossell√≥ said.
