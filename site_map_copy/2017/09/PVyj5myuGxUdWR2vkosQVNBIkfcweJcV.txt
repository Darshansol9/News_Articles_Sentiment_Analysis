POLITICSPresident Trump is in New York to welcome world leaders to the United Nations General Assembly, the first of his presidency. He has meetings today with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and French President Emanuel Macron. Tomorrow, things really get interesting, when Trump gives a speech at the UN to a world body he's often criticized. Global leaders will be parsing Trump's words on such big topics as climate change, refugee policy and North Korea while looking for signs that the "America First" US President may be willing to take a more collaborative approach on some issues. Observers also will be watching Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, whose voice as America's top diplomat is sometimes overshadowed by his tweet-happy boss.Speaking of the President's favorite social platform, Trump retweeted an edited video yesterday that showed him swinging a golf club and appearing to hit his former presidential campaign rival Hillary Clinton with a golf ball, knocking her to the ground. Neither the White House nor Clinton would comment on the tweet, and some Trump surrogates said it shouldn't be taken seriously. But it drew swift criticism from some who argued it made light of violence against women and renewed questions about whether Trump's handlers can rein in his erratic Twitter habits.Also this week: the GOP is seriously considering trying one last time to repeal Obamacare.JUST WATCHED Haley: Trump right on UN 'incompetence' in 2016 Replay More Videos ...
