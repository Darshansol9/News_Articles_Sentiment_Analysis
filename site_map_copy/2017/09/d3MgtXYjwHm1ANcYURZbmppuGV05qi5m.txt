(CNN) Puerto Rico's governor said officials were working to get food, fuel and water "everywhere on the island" as millions of people continued to suffer without the basics and reports emerged of vital supplies stranded at Puerto Rico's main port.About 97% of the US commonwealth's 3.4 million residents were still in the dark Wednesday, one week after Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico, Gov. Ricardo Rossell√≥ said. About half the residents do not have running water.Puerto Ricans are waiting hours in line to get gas, food and cash. Gas stations and supermarkets are rationing supplies, while banks are running low on cash."Right now we are in emergency mode," Rossell√≥ said on Wednesday afternoon. "Our focus is not necessarily restoring energy. The energy grid has been destroyed. ... And we need to rebuild it. That does not get rebuilt in days."Asked if he thought the federal government was doing everything it can to help the island, Rossell√≥ said, "Well, they are. This is an unprecedented event. President Trump has been in close communication with me practically every day making sure we have the assets, giving orders to his team so that they can execute."The governor said getting aid where it's needed has been a challenge because of the magnitude of the destruction on the island."This has been the biggest catastrophe in the history Puerto Rico in terms of natural disasters," he said.Critics said the government's aid effort could be improved if Washington lifted the Jones Act, an obscure, nearly 100-year-old law that requires all goods ferried between US ports to be carried on ships built, owned and operated by Americans. The law had the unintended consequence of making it more expensive to ship things from the US mainland to Puerto Rico. Trump said Wednesday "we're thinking" about lifting the Jones Act for Puerto Rican ports in the wake of Hurricane Maria, but he said a "lot of shippers" don't want it lifted.Rossell√≥ said he had not asked the President to lift the Jones Act so aid might flow more fully to Puerto Rico. "I did not solicit that to him personally but it is something that would help Puerto Rico, certainly, at least in the short run," Rossell√≥ said.As desperate Puerto Ricans wait for aid, there's not enough food to go around. In the town of Utuado, Lydia Rivera has started to ration crackers and drink rainwater to keep her two grandchildren alive."No water, no food," Rivera told CNN.People carry water in bottles retrieved from a canal this week in Toa Alta, Puerto Rico.Federal relief effortsWith supplies running out, many Puerto Ricans are collecting water from mountain streams.JUST WATCHED Hundreds stranded at Puerto Rican airport Replay More Videos ...

They've heard on the radio that trucks loaded with supplies from the Federal Emergency Management Agency have arrived on the island."We haven't seen any," Torres said.Some help began arriving. On Wednesday, a plane carrying 3,500 pounds of water, Army meals ready-to-eat, diapers and other supplies headed from Florida to Puerto Rico. The plane, which usually carries out intelligence missions, returned to the US mainland with dozens of family members of federal employees.Two military officials told CNN on Wednesday that another 2,000 to 3,000 US troops will be sent to Puerto Rico in the coming days to assist with aid. One official with US Northern Command said there are approximately 2,500 active-duty troops in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. This does not include National Guard forces.3500 pounds of supplies headed to Puerto Rico on a DASH 8 CBP plane, @cnn team will be onboard. pic.twitter.com/SieEyrIyqp ‚Äî Rosa Flores (@RosaFlores) September 27, 2017"We are getting help from the federal government, but this is an unprecedented set of circumstances," Rossell√≥ said Wednesday. "We want to make sure that we recognize that a lot of resources are coming in. They are coming in by air or by boats. But they are starting to execute."Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands have seen fewer personnel since Hurricane Maria hit than Texas and Florida did during recent hurricanes in those states.FEMA said more than 10,000 federal staff members were on the ground in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands assisting search-and-rescue and recovery efforts.10k+ federal staff are on the ground in PR/USVI assisting with search & rescue, restoring power, & moving commodities. #Maria [üì∑: @USArmy] pic.twitter.com/8mbThIzD7T ‚Äî FEMA (@fema) September 25, 2017Trump announced he will visit Puerto Rico next Tuesday, nearly two weeks after Maria struck the US commonwealth."Puerto Rico is a very difficult situation," he said Wednesday.

When the hospital ran out of diesel Monday, the ventilators had to run on batteries for hours until another hospital offered them fuel."We were very thankful for that. We were very lucky," Cruz Vivaldi said.The hospital is working to secure more gas, he said, because that diesel will only last about two days.'People are starting to get desperate'Before sunrise every day, dozens of people hauling red plastic gas cans start lining up at gas stations.
