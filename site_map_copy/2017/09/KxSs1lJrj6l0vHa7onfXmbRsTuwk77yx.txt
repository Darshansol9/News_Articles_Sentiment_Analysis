Hurricane IrmaIt wasn't strong winds or floodwaters that killed people at a Florida nursing home -- it was the lack of power. Eight residents at the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills died after Hurricane Irma knocked out electricity. The center didn't have air conditioning for three days, leaving the staff scrambling to keep residents hydrated and cool with fans and portable air units. Several state agencies have started investigations, and Florida's governor issued an emergency moratorium to keep the nursing home from admitting new patients.2.

Hillary Clinton's doing her part to keep it going by talking about her new book, which tries to explain "What Happened" and why she lost. She blames herself, of course, but also James Comey , the Electoral College , the Russians. And those folks who've been coming up to her post-election saying they regret not voting last year? Save your breath , she says. Clinton is not forgiving you.JUST WATCHED Clinton: No absolution to those who didn't vote Replay More Videos ...

The former national security adviser told House investigators she wanted to know why the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates was in New York late last year, sources told CNN. Foreign dignitaries usually notify the US government of visits, and the UAE hadn't mentioned that Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan was in town. This New York trip preceded a separate effort by the UAE to facilitate a back-channel communication between Russia and the incoming Trump White House.Rice's previously undisclosed revelation shines new light on a practice that had come under sharp criticism from House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes and the President, who previously accused Rice of committing a crime . But her explanation appears to have satisfied some influential Republicans, undercutting Nunes and Trump, and raising new questions about whether any Trump associates tried to arrange back-channel discussions with the Russians.JUST WATCHED Rice told investigators why she unmasked Trump officials Replay More Videos ...
