In the weeks since the shooting in Parkland, Florida, survivors and their allies have turned their grief into activism and advocacy . Part of that effort is Wednesday's national school walkout.Here's what you should know:What is it?The nationwide protest is both a memorial and protest action. Students and teachers across the United States will walk out of their schools and universities to honor the lives of the 17 people killed at Stoneman Douglas and press lawmakers to pass stricter gun control laws, according to EMPOWER, the group organizing the action.Ban assault weaponsRequire universal background checks before gun salesPass a gun violence restraining order law that would allow courts to disarm people who display warning signs of violent behaviorJUST WATCHED Florida student to politicians: We call 'BS' Replay More Videos ...

But the idea originated with EMPOWER , the youth branch of the Women's March, and it's the main national voice encouraging people to participate. The organization's website says more than 2,500 walkouts are plannedEMPOWER is facilitating the walkout by providing local student organizers with tool kits to help them get started. The kits include a step-by-step guide to organizing a walkout, sample letters to administrators to request permission to participate and an explanation of students' rights.The organizers have asked anyone not affiliated with a school to stay away from the walkouts, citing safety concerns. Otherwise, folks who want to express solidarity with the students should wear orange or walk out of their workplaces for 17 minutes, EMPOWER says.Enough is enough!Women's March Youth EMPOWER is calling for students, teachers, and allies to take part in a #NationalSchoolWalkout for 17 minutes at 10am on March 14, 2018.

Some school districts that originally took that stance have since backed off and have tried to compromise.The Needville Independent School District in Texas said several weeks ago that anyone participating in walkouts or protests would be suspended for three daysWhat are students' rights?While students do have a First Amendment right to protest, those whose schools forbid participation in the walkout could still legitimately face consequences.Vera Eidelman, a fellow at the American Civil Liberties Union, said schools could punish students if they miss class, even if they're joining the walkout. "But what the school can't do," Eidelman said , "is discipline students more harshly because they are walking out to express a political view or because school administrators don't support the views behind the protest."Basically, the punishment students receive can't be any worse than what they would have otherwise received for skipping class on any other day.JUST WATCHED Shooting survivors ask Congress #WHATIF Replay More Videos ...
