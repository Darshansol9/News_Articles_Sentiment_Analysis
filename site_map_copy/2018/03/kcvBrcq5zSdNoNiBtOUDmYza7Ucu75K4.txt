Headlines like this should not have to be typed up every week. All of these incidents have one thing in common.

Because he ( Zachary Cruz ) entered the school. We have so many cops but he still got on campus... I think the cops need to stop socializing and pay attention to what is going on."They noted the different reactions of the two schools' resource officersA Great Mills school resource officer leaped into action and killed the shooter, authorities said. But in the Parkland shooting, a school resource officer never entered the building to confront the gunman.Kai Koerber:"The action taken by the resource officer at Great Mills High School was an act of true heroism that may have saved countless lives.""Had our resource officer taken action immediately, the result of the Stoneman Douglas Valentine's Day Massacre would have been different, we might not have had to walk over the bodies of our classmates, once lovely and wonderful people, as we were led away from murderous tragedy."Connor Deitrich:"It's nice to know that at least the person they relied on helped, but it makes me more angry at our SRO for doing absolutely nothing."Jack Macleod:"I'm not sure how big Mills High is, but I know Douglas is absolutely huge. I'm relieved that the shooting there was apparently contained quickly. Until we find out exactly who was where and why officers didn't go in on that day for us though, I don't have much else to say about what happened with them here."Demitri Hoth:"That officer (at Great MIlls) did what he is supposed to do. And/or the protcols they have in place at their sheriffs office are better than here. It makes me feel angry that the protocols were not effective in our situation."
