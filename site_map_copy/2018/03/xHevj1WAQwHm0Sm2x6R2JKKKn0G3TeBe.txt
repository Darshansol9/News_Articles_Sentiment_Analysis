(CNN) A family friend who cared for Florida shooter Nikolas Cruz said she forbade him from bringing his guns into her home and warned police several times that he might have a weapon and harm himself or others.Rocxanne Deschamps spoke publicly for the first time Tuesday about the brief time Cruz and his younger brother, Zachary, lived with her family after the boys' mother died last fall.Deschamps said her family made three 911 calls during that time. She raised concerns about Cruz owning a gun and also told police Cruz had once put a gun to the head of his mother and brother. Each time, police told her there was nothing they could do about her concerns, she said."I did everything I could to warn law enforcement about [what] could happen," she told reporters in a news conference with celebrity attorney Gloria Allred.

Unfortunately, although I did everything I could, I was not able to stop this tragedy taking place."Read More
