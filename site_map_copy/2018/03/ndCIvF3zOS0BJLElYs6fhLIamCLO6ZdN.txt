Story highlights United Airlines apologizes for the mix-upIrgo is headed back home today(CNN) United Airlines wrongly shipped a Kansas-bound pet dog to Japan, the second embarrassment this week for the airline and a "nightmare" for the Swindle family -- who are moving from Oregon to Wichita with their beloved pet, a 10-year-old German shepherd named Irgo.The ordeal began Tuesday when Kara Swindle went to retrieve Irgo at a United Airlines cargo facility in Kansas City.

Irgo is suffering from an ear infection and hasn't had medication in three days, she said.Read More
