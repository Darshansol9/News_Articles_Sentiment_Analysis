But that forecast could change.No fierce storms are expected for Northeastern states late Friday or Saturday, CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said. A few snow showers are expected for the interior portions of New York and New England.Areas closer to the coast that were hit the hardest with the last storm won't see any snow this weekend, Ward said.
