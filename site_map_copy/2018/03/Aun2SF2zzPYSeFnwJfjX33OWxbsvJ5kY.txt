Winter storm watches already cover more than 33 million people, including New York City and Boston.While the winds don't look quite as strong as this most recent storm, this next one is forecast to be more of a classic nor'easter, with heavy snow possible for the major metropolitan areas.The biggest impacts from the storm will likely be from Wednesday into Thursday morning.
