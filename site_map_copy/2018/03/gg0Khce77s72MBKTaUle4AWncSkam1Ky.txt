(CNN) No charges will be filed against two Baton Rouge police officers in the 2016 shooting death of Alton Sterling, after an investigation determined that the shooting was justified, Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry said Tuesday."We have concluded that the officers in question acted as reasonable officers under existing law and were justified in their use of force," Landry's written report on the investigation reads.But his decision is not the last chapter of the case, as the police department plans to hold hearings on whether to discipline the officers, and says it intends to release four videos that have yet to be made public.Landry's announcement in Baton Rouge -- coming 10 months after federal prosecutors determined they wouldn't file civil rights charges against the officers -- was made moments after he told Sterling's relatives of the decision.JUST WATCHED Lawmaker wants Sterling's killer prosecuted Replay More Videos ...

Sterling's aunt Veda Washington wiped tears as she left his office."They're not going to bring charges on anybody. Why would they do that? This is white America," Washington said.Outrage over Sterling's death led to renewed Black Lives Matter protests across the nation.Landry said his conclusion drew on the federal investigation -- including two use-of-force experts who told the Justice Department that the shooting was reasonable -- as well as his department's own interviews of eyewitnesses.The officers, he said, tried to make a lawful arrest, tried Tasering and other nonlethal techniques to subdue Sterling when he didn't comply with commands, and made "well-founded and reasonable" attempts to control Sterling's hands until the moment one officer claims he saw Sterling try to reach a gun.Attorneys for Sterling's family slammed what they called a biased decision -- and urged the public to hold Landry accountable by voting him out of office."It takes courage ... to fight for justice; we didn't see that in this situation," family attorney Chris Stewart said."But that's fine, because ... we know what the repercussion is: Getting you out of office."More videos, and a decision on the officers' future, are comingRepercussions still could come for Officers Blane Salamoni, who shot Sterling, and Officer Howie Lake II. Sterling's five children filed a wrongful death lawsuit last summer.JUST WATCHED Witness: Sterling's gun was not visible at any point Replay More Videos ...

"And when you cry again, you'll be telling the Sterling family, 'I'm sorry.'"Sterling was shot on the groundSterling was known as the "CD man," who sold CDs and DVDs outside the convenience store where he was shot, according to local media.The killing gripped the nation in part because two publicly released bystander videos , each less than a minute long, captured Sterling's part of the struggle with the two officers.The officers were responding to a call about a man with a gun. The call was from a homeless man who said that after he approached Sterling for money, Sterling showed him the weapon.According to the state report released Tuesday, Sterling refused to heed the officers' commands to put his hands on the hood of a car, and each officer reached for and tried to control Sterling's arms.JUST WATCHED Witness: Sterling's gun was not visible at any point Replay More Videos ...

Salamoni eventually holstered his gun, tackled Sterling to the ground and tried to control Sterling's right arm, and Lake knelt and tried to control Sterling's left arm, the state report says."If you move, I swear to God," Salamoni tells Sterling, according to the report.At one point, the cell phone videos show, someone shouts, "He's got a gun!" In one video, an officer draws something from his waistband and points it at Sterling.Landry wrote at this moment Sterling was positioned in way that concealed his right front pocket. The officers continue to try to control his hands."He's going for the gun," Salamoni yells, according to the state report.The state report says Salamoni first shot Sterling three times in the chest, and then rolled off him.Sterling sits up. As Lake yelled at Sterling to get on the ground, Sterling rolled away from Salamoni, who fired three more shots, this time into Sterling's back. Sterling's hands and right side are concealed from Salamoni's view, Landry said.Lake removed a loaded .38-caliber handgun from Sterling's right front pocket, the report says.An autopsy report done by the East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office said none of the six bullets exited Sterling's body. A pathologist also found a Taser probe embedded in the back of his shorts, says the report, which was released Tuesday.Attorney general: Drugs may have contributedThe feds cited use-of-force experts who determined the officers' actions were reasonable under the circumstances -- including that the two used several less-than-lethal techniques before using force, and that Sterling struggled with the officers and failed to follow orders.The Justice Department also said that evidence couldn't prove or disprove Salamoni's assertion that Sterling was reaching for a gun.JUST WATCHED Alton Sterling's son speaks out Replay More Videos ...

"In our opinion, that is criminal."
