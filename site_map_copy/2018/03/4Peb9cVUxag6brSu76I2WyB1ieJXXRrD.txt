Its pontoons did inflate but then it flipped upside down and sank into the water.The pilot was able to remove himself from his harness and escape, but all five passengers died from accidental drowning, the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner said.The helicopter was owned by Liberty Helicopters.
