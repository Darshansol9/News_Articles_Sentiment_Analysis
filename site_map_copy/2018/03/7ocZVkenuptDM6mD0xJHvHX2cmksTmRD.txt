(CNN) Despite announcing the death of the man suspected to be behind a series of deadly bombings in Austin, authorities still want people to report any suspicious packages or devices they see.The community was on edge after the explosion of several package bombs and other devices since March 2 -- attacks that left two people dead and five others hurt -- but officials announced early Wednesday that the man they believe was responsible for the attacks -- later identified as Mark Anthony Conditt, 23 -- died when a device blew up on his car as authorities closed in on him.Before that development, officials evacuated and then reopened several grocery stores, apartment buildings and restaurants as more tips and concerns were called in about suspicious packages. The sight of yellow crime scene tape and the sound of helicopters overhead were becoming a common occurrence as law enforcement officials searched for clues and the suspect."This is terrorizing the city of Austin," Rep. Michael McCaul told President Donald Trump at a law enforcement roundtable on Tuesday, before police zeroed in on Conditt.At a police briefing on Tuesday, City Council Member Ann Kitchen said residents were coming to her and other city leaders with worries about the explosions.
