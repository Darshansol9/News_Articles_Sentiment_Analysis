(CNN) The 13 children of David and Louise Turpin, the California couple accused of holding their children captive and torturing 12 of them, are now enjoying freedom in three separate homes in Riverside County, authorities said on Monday.Word of their new homes follows a statement from Corona Regional Medical Center CEO Mark Uffer announcing that the Turpin siblings had been released from the hospital.Six of the children are minors and seven are adults.The adult children had been recovering at Corona Regional for the past two months, and it was hard to see them go, Uffer said. "There were some tears flowing, both for the staff and the Turpin children," he said. "They said they loved us, they were going to miss us, they hoped to see us soon.""We're hopeful they can now learn a lot of life skills, from shopping for groceries to cooking," he said. "For all the things that have allegedly been done to them, they still have the capacity to love and trust people who have been good to them. Their spirit has not been crushed."Read More
