SpaceX launched another rocket today.Here's what went right: Liftoff occurred just after 10 a.m. ET from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, and the primary mission went off without a hitch. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket delivered a group of 10 satellites into orbit for communications firm Iridium.Here's what didn't: SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter that as the $6 million fairing, or nose cone, fell back toward Earth, the parafoils that were supposed to slow its descent became tangled.So the "fairing impacted water at high speed," Musk said. That likely destroyed it.SpaceX had hoped to land the nose cone into a giant seaborne net.
