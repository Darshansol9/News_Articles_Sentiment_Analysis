(CNN) Lawmakers in Florida are tired of the whole "fall back" and "spring forward" rigamarole. So they've approved a bill to keep Daylight Saving Time going throughout the year in their state.It took the state Senate less than a minute Tuesday to pass the "Sunshine Protection Act ." There were only two dissenters. (The House passed it 103-11 on February 14.)The bill now goes to the desk of Gov. Rick Scott -- but it's far from a done deal after that,Even if the governor approves, a change like this will literally take an act of Congress.But if all is approved, Floridians -- who'll set their clocks ahead one hour this Sunday when Daylight Saving Time begins -- won't have to mess with it ever again.
