(CNN) No one was going to rain on Atlanta United's parade.Two days after Atlanta won its first MLS championship, its downtown was awash in red, black and gold Monday as trophy-thirsty fans celebrated the juggernaut soccer team and the city's first sports title in 23 years.It was 38 degrees with a light drizzle, but that didn't stop thousands of fans of all ages from lining the streets between the Georgia Aquarium and Mercedes Benz Stadium to catch a glimpse of the team.Police on horseback escorted a giant replica of the MLS Cup down Atlanta's Marietta Street, followed by city dignitaries, team officials, a bus loaded with the championship squad and a flatbed full of fans carrying the team's golden spike, a nod to the city's history as a railroad terminus. Hundreds of other fans on foot sang and carried banners, one of them portraying striker and MLS Cup MVP Josef Martinez as Jesus.Chants of "Vamos, vamos, vamos, ATL!" erupted as the team bus -- with defender Leandro Gonzalez PÃ­rez front and center atop it -- passed the College Football Hall of Fame and turned toward the CNN Center. Fans, known as the 17s, threw scarves, hats and balls onto the convertible bus. The players signed them and tossed them back to fans in the crowd.
