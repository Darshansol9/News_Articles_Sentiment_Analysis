(CNN) A church in Oklahoma put a fence around its Nativity scene to send a message: "The Holy Family Was A Migrant Family."Chris Moore, pastor of the Fellowship Congregational Church in Tulsa, said there's a parallel between migrants who come to the US-Mexico border seeking asylum and the Christmas story. He specifically mentioned the Gospel of St. Matthew, which details how Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus fled to Egypt to escape persecution from Herod."Though it is not a direct comparison, the details in Matthew's Gospel ... can be used to consider the people fleeing to our country seeking shelter from oppression and violence," Moore told CNN.The display was set up outside the church the first Sunday of December. It is over 20 years old and shows Mary holding baby Jesus, with Joseph by their side, as well as stable animals. A chain link fence was arranged around the traditional Christmas scene.Moore said the fence created some confusion, with some thinking the church was trying to protect the display from theft. As a result, the church changed its marquee earlier this week to read "The Holy Family Was A Migrant Family."
