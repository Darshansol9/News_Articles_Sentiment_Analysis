(CNN) Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf on Friday signed a tough anti-hazing bill that bears the name of a Penn State student who died last year during fraternity pledging.The law is named for Timothy Piazza, a 19-year-old engineering major whose excessive drinking on his first night pledging the Beta Theta Pi house led to a series of falls that resulted in a severe head injury and his death the next day, according to court records and testimony. Six men face hazing charges in Piazza's death.The Timothy J. Piazza Anti Hazing Law requires Pennsylvania schools to have policies and reporting procedures in place to stop hazing and to inform students and parents of what is happening on campus.For those found guilty of hazing, penalties could include fines, the withholding of a diploma, and academic punishments ranging from probation to expulsion. The strengthened penalties also now include a felony charge for aggravated hazing that results in serious injury or death.The bill is a "crucial component" in the fight against hazing, Penn State spokeswoman Lisa Powers said. "This law, when passed, in conjunction with the aggressive safety and related measures the University has implemented, is another step toward our mutual goal to increase student safety on campuses. Penn State has been, and continues to be, committed to addressing this serious national issue," she said in a statement.Read More
