(CNN) The Illinois State Capitol is decking the halls with holly, a menorah, and a Satanic statue.This holiday season, the Satanic Temple of Chicago has been granted permission to place their statue in the lobby of the state Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois, a spokesman for the Secretary of State's office told CNN.The statue is approximately four and a half feet tall and about 18 inches long, spokesman Dave Druker said, and it depicts a snake wrapped around an arm holding an apple with the inscription "knowledge is the greatest gift."The statue has been on display since Monday and will remain through the end of the month, according to officials."We feel it's a First Amendment issue, we have other displays there -- a Hanukkah menorah and Nativity scene," Drucker said. "If you have displays of one type you need to be consistent and allow everyone to do so, aside from hate speeches and other unacceptable things."Read More
