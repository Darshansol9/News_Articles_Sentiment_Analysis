New York (CNN) The late mobster John Gotti, the self-styled "Dapper Don," was a natty dresser known for his custom-tailored, double breasted suits, silk ties with matching pocket squares and handmade shoes.If the first week of testimony in Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán Loera's trial is any indication, jurors may be in for more grisly tales of bloodshed and deep-rooted corruption when court is back in session.But alleged drug kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, whose financial success once put him on a Forbes magazine billionaires list, has gone decidedly more downscale during his federal trial in New York, according to one of his attorneys.While Guzman's wealth could have afforded him the finest threads, the diminutive defendant from a small mountain town in the northern Mexican state of Sinaloa always seemed to prefer loud silk shirts with jeans or dark slacks, according to photographs over the years.At his high-profile trial in room 8D at US District Court in Brooklyn, Guzman has been donning off-the-rack suits from Kmart."We bring them. We get them cleaned," defense attorney Eduardo Balarezo said of the five or so budget retailer suits picked out by members of Guzman's legal team. "Enough clothes that he can rotate."
