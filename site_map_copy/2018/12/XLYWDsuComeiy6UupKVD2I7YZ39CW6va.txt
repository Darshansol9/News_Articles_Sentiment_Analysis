(CNN) A letter penned by one of the greatest minds in history is expected to fetch at least a cool million when it goes up for auction on December 4.Albert Einstein's 1954 letter to religious philosopher Erik Gutkind is commonly referred to as the "God letter," and it features Einstein politely but very thoroughly roasting the concept of religion and God in general.It is considered "one of the definitive statements in the Religion vs. Science debate," said Peter Klarnet, a senior specialist in books and manuscripts at Christie's auction house, in a release provided to CNN.The letter was written in German in 1954, a year before Einstein died.The letter, written in German a year before Einstein's death and transcribed in English by Christie's, is a reaction to Gutkind's 1952 book, "Choose Life: the Biblical Call to Revolt." While Einstein makes it clear he and the philosopher had a lot in common "with regard to the factual attitude to life and to the human community," he makes his position on religion swiftly and abundantly clear."The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weakness, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still purely primitive, legends which are nevertheless pretty childish," Einstein writes.
