(CNN) If you haven't heard the words "freekeh" or "entomophagy," it's probably because most Americans are trying to make sure they don't have to say either.After all, they both scored top slots in this year's "most mispronounced words." Language-learning app Babel commissioned the U.S. Captioning Company to compile the words that proved most tricky for newscasters and television personalities to pronounce.Americans struggled with pronouncing Brett Kavanaugh's last name during the September hearings, and twisted their tongues trying to sound out "Saoirse Ronan" after watching "Lady Bird." And during midterm season, none of us swallowed our pride to ask, "How do you pronounce Beto 'O'Rourke?'"Babbel's director of language learning Miriam Plieninger says the words offer an insight to what national conversation revolves around each year."By highlighting these tricky-to-pronounce names, places and trends, we're not looking to shame those who mispronounce, but offer an understanding of language and culture which is key to unlocking many aspects of society," she said.
