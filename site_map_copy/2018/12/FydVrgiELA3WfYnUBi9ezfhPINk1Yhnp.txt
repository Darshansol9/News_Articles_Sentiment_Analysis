New York (CNN) In the procession of cartel members and law enforcement agents who have testified against Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, the face of former Colombian drug lord Juan Carlos Ramirez Abadia stood out.Ramirez, also known as "Chupeta," or lollipop, is also notorious for having multiple plastic surgeries to alter his face and evade authorities. He entered federal court in Brooklyn on Thursday wearing a black puffer coat and winter gloves and only glanced at his former trafficking partner once.The pair worked together for nearly 18 years. Ramirez's associates would grow and process cocaine and fly it to Mexico, bribing authorities in both countries to look the other way.

DEA agent Scott Schoonover pulled out a bag so heavy with bricks of cocaine that it clanked as it hit the prosecution table, as curious jurors peered at the mound. The sample was from a seizure that ranked in the top five biggest seizures in his 36 years with the agency.Guzman has remained fixated on those testifying against him, entering court each day in suits his legal team says are from Kmart and smiling and waving at his wife who has attended each of the nine days of trial so far.Read More
