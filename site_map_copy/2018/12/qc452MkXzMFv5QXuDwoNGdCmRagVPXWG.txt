(CNN) Heather Heyer was killed in Charlottesville just as she and her mother had navigated some growing pains and learned to enjoy each other's company, her mother said WednesdaySpeaking the day after Heyer's killer was sentenced to life in prison plus 419 years , Susan Bro told CNN that while they weren't best friends, they had become friends, making her killing at an August 2017 white nationalist rally "a punch in the jaw.""I'd finally gotten through the adolescent years, which were tough. I had gotten through her 20s, which were interesting, to say the least, as she established herself in her own apartment and working," she said. "We were finally at a point where I felt like we had an actual friendship beyond just mother-daughter friendship."We enjoyed each other's company a couple of times a month. We would meet for dinner and have long talks. We would text each other once in a while," Bro said.JUST WATCHED Heyer's mother: How could I not be strong? Replay More Videos ...
