(CNN) Delaware has made history as the first state in the nation to ban child marriage under all circumstances.Democratic Gov. John Carney signed a bill this week making it illegal for anyone under age 18 to get married, even with parental consent.Despite most US state laws setting the age of marital consent at 18, every other state and the District of Columbia have loopholes for minors seeking marriage licenses, experts say. Texas and Virginia, for instance last year enacted new laws limiting marriage to those 18 and older, but they made narrow exceptions for minors granted adult rights by the courts.First State claims another 1st: No more child marriages. Period. https://t.co/pDsrTPmGDL via @WDEL â€” Rep. Kim Williams DE (@kimwilliamsde) May 11, 2018
