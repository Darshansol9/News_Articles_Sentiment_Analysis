(CNN) University of Southern California President C. L. Max Nikias has agreed to step down following a scandal involving a former campus gynecologist accused of sexual misconduct and using racist language during exams.In a tweet Friday, USC said the school and Nikias "have agreed to begin an orderly transition and commence the process of selecting a new president."The announcement comes after thousands of students and alumni signed an online petition demanding his resignation, alleging that USC failed to act after complaints of misconduct involving Dr. George Tyndall, a gynecologist who worked at a university clinic for decades.A USC faculty organization had asked Nikias, who has been president since August 2010, to resign. The group passed its resolution Wednesday night, voting 24-0 with four abstentions, said Paul Rosenbloom, a computer science professor who is president of the USC academic senate.Tyndall was fired last year for inappropriate behavior, according to USC. University officials said the school reached a settlement with the doctor and did not report him to law enforcement or state medical authorities at the time.Read More
