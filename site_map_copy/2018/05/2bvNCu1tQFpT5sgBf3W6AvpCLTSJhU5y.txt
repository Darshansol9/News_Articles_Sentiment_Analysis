North Korea threatened to abandon that planned historic summit between leader Kim Jong Un and President Trump, set for next month in Singapore. The North said it wasn't going to be pushed into nuclear disarmament by the US. This comes after the regime suddenly suspended high level-talks with South Korea because the South is currently conducting military drills with the US.This sudden step backward is stunning after Kim's well-received meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in a few weeks ago, in which the two leaders vowed to officially end the Korean War. But then again, the North is known for doing this type of thing: engaging in a charm offensive and then backtracking. But experts doubt the North will abandon a chance to engage directly with a US president, something it's wanted for a long time.ImmigrationChildren caught crossing the US border illegally might be held on military bases -- and away from their families. The Trump administration is looking at three sites in Texas and one in Arkansas to hold minors, a Defense Department official says. It's the clearest sign yet the administration aims to move forward with a plan to split up families who cross the border illegally. Critics denounce the plan as heartless, but Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defended it, saying similar separations happen in the US "every day." And the Obama administration also used military bases to hold immigrant children.JUST WATCHED Sanders: Trump immigration policy is 'heartless' Replay More Videos ...

UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres said he was "profoundly alarmed" by the killings, and the UK wants an independent inquiry. The leaders of France and Germany expressed their concerns to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. One country that's not slamming Israel: the US, which blamed the deaths on Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza and which encouraged the protests related to the US Embassy opening in Jerusalem. The Palestinian Health Ministry said Monday's violence was the deadliest day in Gaza since 2014.JUST WATCHED The history of Gaza in 2 minutes Replay More Videos ...

Wolfe, the author of "The Bonfire of the Vanities" and "The Right Stuff," died at age 88 after being hospitalized with an infection. The journalist and author also helped popularize what became known as New Journalism, a long-form writing style in which writers became deeply immersed in the subjects they wrote about. His sense of style didn't end with the written word, either. His signature white, three-piece suits made their mark on New York's social scene as well.JUST WATCHED Innovative journalist Tom Wolfe dies Replay More Videos ...
