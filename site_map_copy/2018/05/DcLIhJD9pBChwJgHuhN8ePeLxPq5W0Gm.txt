(CNN) A Georgia police officer who choked former NFL prospect Desmond Marrow during an arrest in December has been fired, officials said.On Thursday, Henry County Police Chief Mark Amerman said the officer's employment was terminated after an internal affairs investigation revealed his use of force was unnecessary. The officer, David Rose, was recorded on his in-car video camera saying he choked Marrow, Amerman said, and intended to leave that information out of his police report recounting the incident.CNN's attempts to reach Rose for comment have been unsuccessful. The police union has also not responded to CNN's requests for comment or confirmation that they represent Rose.The actions of another officer who was involved were found to be within department policy, Amerman said.The Henry County District Attorney's Office announced it was dismissing a felony charge of obstruction of an officer against Marrow. And misdemeanor charges, including reckless and aggressive driving, are under review by the office of the solicitor general, said District Attorney Darius Pattillo.Read More
