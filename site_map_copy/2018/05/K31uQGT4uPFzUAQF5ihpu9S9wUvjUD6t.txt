This weekend our friend @NowThatsMajor sang at a very special wedding and we couldn't help but share âœ¨ Marcus & Marissa Martin said "I do" months after cameras captured Marcus's body in the air having pushed his fiancÃ© out of the way of a driver who plowed through peaceful protesters in Charlottesville, VA. Marcus's injuries made it impossible for him to work so community members donated services so the couple could become one. The two also lost a friend in the attack, Heather Heyer, and they honored her memory by making purple their wedding color ðŸ’œ We wish them all joy in the world as they go through life as husband and wife.A post shared by Black Love Docuseries (@blacklovedoc) on May 14, 2018 at 6:24pm PDT
