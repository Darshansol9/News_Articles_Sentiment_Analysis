(CNN) Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's re-election website has abandoned a contest to give away a $250 voucher toward a shotgun purchase days after the slaying of 10 people at Santa Fe High School.Previously, participants in the giveaway entered with a chance to win a $250 certificate that could be redeemable for a "Texas-made shotgun" at a licensed gun dealer in Central Texas, per the campaign's website.Now the website doesn't mention the gun. It only offers a $250 gift certificate. The giveaway was dropped from the website after CNN's story published on Sunday.John Wittman, a campaign spokesman, said Monday the change was made over the weekend because of the mass shooting.The drawing began May 1 -- before the shooting in Santa Fe -- and ends May 31. The website still touted the gun giveaway on Sunday, two days after Friday's mass shooting.Read More
