Her story recently caught the attention of A-list celebrities and inspired the viral hashtag #FreeCyntoiaBrown, even though her life sentence began more than a decade ago.At a clemency hearing Wednesday, the six-member Tennessee Board of Parole split on its recommendation in her case, said panel spokeswoman Melissa McDonald. Two board members voted to grant clemency, two voted to deny clemency and the others voted to make Brown, 30, eligible for parole after serving 25 years, she said."I can't say that I deserve or I'm entitled to anything because I'm not," Brown told the board during her testimony, according to CNN affiliate WKRN in Nashville."I wasn't even entitled to this hearing.
