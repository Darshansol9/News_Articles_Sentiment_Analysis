Aliso Viejo, California (CNN) A deadly explosion at a California day spa that killed the business owner, was likely caused by a device and was not accidental, authorities said Wednesday.The explosion Tuesday blew out walls and windows of the facility, heavily damaging the business, which was on the first floor of a two-story medical office building in Aliso Viejo, about 50 miles southeast of Los Angeles, according to Orange County officials. The powerful blast injured three people and caused the ground to shake in nearby structures.Evidence shows the materials believed to be involved in the explosion were not consistent with items used at a day spa, Orange County Undersheriff Don Barnes said. Authorities are treating the explosion as a crime, but are still working to confirm if the blast was intentional. No arrests have been made.Earlier, a law enforcement source told CNN that the explosion may have been detonated on purpose, but the source also cautioned that the investigation was in its preliminary stages."At this point, we do not believe this was an accident. We've ruled out a gas main explosion and other potential theories," said Paul Delacourt, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office. "At this point, our working theory is that this explosion was caused by a device."Read More
