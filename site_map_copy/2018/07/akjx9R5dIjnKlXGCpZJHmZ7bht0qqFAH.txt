(CNN) Just a month after a momentous change, and a year after a scandal shook the Miss America Organization to its core, there's more trouble in its ranks.This week, a group of 22 state pageants signed a petition calling for the resignation of the organization's entire board of trustees. This includes chairwoman Gretchen Carlson, who was just appointed to the position in January.According to the petition, obtained by The Press of Atlantic City, representatives from the 22 state pageants aren't convinced by the organization's new direction, and want more accountability at the top."The recent ouster of two duly elected Trustees, followed by the resignations of two elected Miss Americas from the nine-member Board, have underscored our grave concerns regarding the direction in which MAO is headed, its financial viability, and the expected exercise of all duties attendant to each Trustee as required by law," the petition reads.Participants in the 2018 Miss America competition on September 10, 2017, in Atlantic City."We were promised transparency, competence, and adherence to best practices and good governance. The current Trustees and identified staff member have both individually and collectively failed to deliver on those promises and commitments. In our opinion their leadership has demonstrated that 'Miss America 2.0' is simply a new title for the same old tactics of obfuscation and fear-based governance."
