As they crossed an intersection, the driver of a truck revved his engine and sped toward them.The couple yelled, "What the f***, dude?" and as the driver made a U-turn, the men inside the cab told them to get out of the street and used a homophobic slur, she said. A man exited the truck, approached the couple and said something about beating the women, Dragoon said."I turned on my camera when my wife stepped off the curb and as he was backing away," she said.It's unclear what preceded the video, but it shows the man threatening to harm the women.
