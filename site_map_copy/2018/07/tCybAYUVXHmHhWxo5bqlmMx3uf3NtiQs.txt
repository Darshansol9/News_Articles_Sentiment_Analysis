(CNN) Geologists monitoring the eruption of the Kilauea volcano say it could continue to spout lava for a long time.The volcano has been erupting since early May in the Leilani Estates neighborhood on Hawaii's big island, forcing evacuations and destroying more than 700 homes . The US Geological Survey's Hawaii Volcano Observatory said the eruption has covered more than 12 square miles (23 square kilometers) with black lava and has added 700 acres of new land to the island.A report from the Hawaii Volcano Observatory found that this eruption, in what geologists call Kilauea's lower East Rift Zone, has produced a greater volume of lava than past eruptions in the area."Given this volume and the sustained withdrawal of magma from the summit reservoir without appreciable deformation in the lower East Rift Zone, it is most likely that the LERZ eruption may continue for months to years," the report said.Read More
