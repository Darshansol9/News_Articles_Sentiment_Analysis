The official said it was to identify victims of human trafficking and ensure only true family members were reunited, but immigrant advocacy groups are appalled because they claim the tests are an invasion of privacy, and could be a problem for young children who can't give consent.Meanwhile, immigration protests dotted the country on the Fourth of July. In New York, a demonstrator managed to scale the base of the Statue of Liberty. Before being coaxed down by police, the woman said she wouldn't come down until "all the children are released."2.

A man and woman from Amesbury are currently in critical condition and being treated for exposure to Novichok, a highly toxic nerve agent first developed in secret by the Soviet Union. Investigators have been retracing the couple's steps and have cordoned off several businesses that they visited out of an abundance of caution.

During that time, Trump is expected to enlist a new Supreme Court pick, meet the British Queen, and have a historic summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In between all of that, Trump will turn his eyes to the NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium.

The head of Poland's Supreme Court, Ma≈Çgorzata Gersdorf, openly defied the law and came to the court building anyway. Critics say the Polish government is eroding the rule of law and that its so-called reforms are intended to give it control of the judiciary. But the government, led by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, insists the measures are needed and will strengthen democracy.Number of the day11 hoursThat's how long a round trip takes for rescue workers to check on the 12 boys and their coach who are trapped in a cave in ThailandBreakfast BrowsePeople are talking about these.
