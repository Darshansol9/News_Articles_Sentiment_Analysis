A portrait of Anne Frank stands in front of a black marble wall with the names of the Hungarian holocaust victims at the memorial of Central Europe's first Holocaust museum in Budapest on January 27, 2014.(CNN) The efforts of Anne Frank's family to emigrate to the United States were thwarted by "American bureaucracy, war, and time," historians say.New joint research by the Anne Frank House and the US Holocaust Memorial Museum indicates the family applied for American visas twice and Anne's father, Otto Frank, applied for a Cuban visa. But these efforts were undermined by suspicious and skeptical immigration officials, wartime events and endless bureaucratic hurdles here and in Europe."I am forced to look out for emigration and as far as I can see the USA is the only country we could go to," Otto Frank wrote in a letter to a friend living in New York.Anne was 13 when she went into hiding from the Nazis with her family in the "Secret Annex," a hidden enclave at the back of her father's former office in Amsterdam, Netherlands. After her family was arrested by the German secret police in 1944, she was taken to a concentration camp in Bergen-Belsen, where she died shortly before the end of World War II.She kept a diary throughout her time in hiding, and after her death, her father published it in 1947.

An English version, The Diary of a Young Girl, was issued in 1952.Read More
