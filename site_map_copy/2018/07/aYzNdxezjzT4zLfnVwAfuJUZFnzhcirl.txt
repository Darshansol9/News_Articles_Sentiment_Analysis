(CNN) Tia Coleman, a survivor of the duck boat disaster in Missouri that claimed 17 lives, said Monday that her husband's attempt to rescue their children is what will keep her going after their loss."Somebody told me that when they found my husband, he had all three of my babies," Coleman told Anderson Cooper on " Anderson Cooper Full Circle ," a daily interactive news show on Facebook Watch. "So the reason I couldn't find them is because he was protecting them.""That right there will keep me fighting for my family forever," Coleman said. "To know that he did (was) exactly what he always told me when we first met: 'I will always take care of you and our children.'"Coleman and 10 of her relatives were on a family vacation from Indiana, taking a tour Thursday of Table Rock Lake near the Missouri tourist hotspot of Branson.When the duck boat they were on capsized as a storm swept the lake, nine of her family members died, including her husband and three children. Coleman and her 13-year-old nephew were the only survivors from their family group.Read More
