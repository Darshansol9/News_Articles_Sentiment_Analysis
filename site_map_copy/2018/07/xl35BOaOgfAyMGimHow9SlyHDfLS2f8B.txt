(CNN) A beauty queen gave up her title after a skit was performed at the Miss Massachusetts competition that made fun of the #MeToo movement.Maude Gorman was one of the contestants in the Miss Massachusetts pageant earlier this month, when a crack about #MeToo was made on stage.Gorman, who said she was gang raped when she was 13, said the moment she heard the joke that she "instantly knew I had to do something. It was going to eat away at me if I didn't," she told CNN.She resigned from her title of Miss Plymouth County 2018 last week, writing on Instagram: "While I'm grateful for the opportunities that @missamerica creates for young women, I am also internally conflicted; as the #metoo movement was mocked on stage during the final competition of Miss Massachusetts. As both a survivor, and advocate for victims rights and sexual violence on a whole, I refuse to stand idly by and simply 'let this go.'"A video containing a portion of the controversial skit was posted by the Observer.Read More
