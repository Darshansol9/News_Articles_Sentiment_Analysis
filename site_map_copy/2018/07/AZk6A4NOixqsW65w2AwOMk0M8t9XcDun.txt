The government has offered no timeline for tracking down hundreds of parents who remain unaccounted for -- a large number of whom are likely to have already been deported to their home countries with no easy way to get in touch with them.The government declared the deadline was met, saying 711 families were ineligible -- either because they had red flags that prevent reunification or because they could not be located in time for the deadline. The number includes...431 children with parents who are no longer in the US, likely those who were deported.94 children had parents whose locations were under review.79 children whose parents were released from government custody into the US and could not be reunited.46 children who had a parent with a red flag for another reason.21 children whose parents had red flags in their background checks.20 children whose parents declined to be reunited.7 children were impacted by a separate court case.The number does not add up to 711 because of some overlap, though the filing didn't specify where the overlaps occurred.
