Whiskey barrels are piled in a heap Wednesday, July 4, 2018, after the rest of the Barton 1792 Distillery, a whiskey storage warehouse, collapsed in Bardstown, Kentucky, nearly two weeks after part of the decades-old structure came crashing down. No injuries were reported in either collapse, said Nelson County Emergency Management spokesman Milt Spalding. (WLKY-TV, CBS Louisville via AP)(CNN) Perhaps it was only a matter of time that the remaining half of a Kentucky bourbon warehouse which collapsed two weeks ago would come crashing down.And now it has. The second half of the building has collapsed, sending another 9,000 barrels of liquor crashing down along with it.The Barton 1792 Distillery in Kentucky, which can store up to 20,000 barrels, was undergoing repairs at the time of the first incident back in June. Barrels from that collapse still haven't been cleaned up because of worker safety concerns, CNN affiliate WLKY reported. It's not clear what caused either collapse."It's not the call you ever want to get, but now we've gotten it twice in just a couple weeks," Milt Spalding, spokesman for Nelson County Emergency Management, told WLKY.Each barrel contains about 53 gallons of liquor.
