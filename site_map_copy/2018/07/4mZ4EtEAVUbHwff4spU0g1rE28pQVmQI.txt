(CNN) A Texas school district is holding an auction to get rid of a warehouse full of Confederate-themed memorabilia left over after the renaming of a high school originally named after Gen. Robert E. Lee.Robert E. Lee High School in San Antonio had its name changed last year after complaints about honoring the Civil War general. It's now called the Legacy of Educational Excellence High School -- or LEE for short.The North East Independent School District says it will build a museum at the school that will house some of the items, including a statue of the Confederate general and copies of mosaics created by students, but there's not enough room for everything that's accumulated over the decades.In a Facebook post earlier this week for the auction, the district said more than 1,000 items would be available, including yearbooks from the 1960s, floor mats, plastic tumblers, T-shirts and dozens of folding chairs with a cartoon general on the seat.
