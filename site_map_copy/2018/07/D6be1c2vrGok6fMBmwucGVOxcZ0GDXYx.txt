(CNN) Disgraced movie producer Harvey Weinstein was indicted on three additional sexual assault charges on Monday, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said in a statement. He now faces charges in connection with alleged incidents involving three women.Weinstein, 66, was charged by a grand jury with one count of commiting a criminal sexual act in the first degree for an alleged forcible sexual act against a woman in July 2006, as well as two counts of felony predatory sexual assault, Vance said.If convicted, the felony predatory sexual assault charges carry a minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.Weinstein attorney Benjamin Brafman said he will enter a plea of not guilty to the new charges."Mr. Weinstein maintains that all of these allegations are false and he expects to be fully vindicated," Brafman said in a statement. "Furthermore, to charge Mr. Weinstein as a predator when the interactions were each consensual is simply not justified."
