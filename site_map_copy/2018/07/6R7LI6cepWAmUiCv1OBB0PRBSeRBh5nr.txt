SpaceX has always said it wants to reuse as much of its rockets as possible, but recovering and reusing a fairing has never been done before. And it's taking some trial and error.If the whole thing goes down as desired, it would look like this:The fairing halves would guide themselves back into the Earth’s atmosphere then deploy parafoils, which are a type of parachute, to slow down the descent.Using on-board navigation systems, the fairing would then steer itself into a net held up by a boat, called Mr. Steven.So what’s Mr. Steven? It’s a crew boat that belongs to a family-owned business in Louisiana. Mr. Steven, built in 2015, was originally intended to work as a supply ship for the oil and gas industry. (Its name is a nod to the ship’s owner, Steven Miguez.)But SpaceX landed a secretive deal to use the ship for its fairing recovery efforts, and the vessel has been retrofitted with long metal arms that hoist up the net to form a giant catcher’s mitt.You can track it on a map right here.
