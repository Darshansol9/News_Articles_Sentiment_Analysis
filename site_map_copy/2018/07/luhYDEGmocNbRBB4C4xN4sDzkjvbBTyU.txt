Columbus, Ohio (CNN) Former Ohio State University wrestling coaches showed their support for fellow former coach Jim Jordan Monday, saying they believe his claims that he was not aware of sexual abuse allegations against a former team doctor."What has been said about Jim Jordan is absolutely wrong. We all worked on the wrestling coaching staff during Jim's tenure at The Ohio State University. None of us saw or heard of abuse of OSU wrestlers. The well-being of student-athletes was all of our concern. If we had heard of any abuse, we would have spoken up," said the statement, signed by former head coach Russ Hellickson and former assistant coaches Dave Ruckman, Rex Holman, Ken Chertow, Myron Kharchilava and Kenny Ramsey Jr."At no time while Jim Jordan was a coach with me at Ohio State did either of us ignore abuse of our wrestlers," Hellickson added.But a former OSU wrestler told CNN that Hellickson and Jordan had to have known athletes were wary of the actions of Dr. Richard Strauss, the former OSU doctor who treated athletes.
