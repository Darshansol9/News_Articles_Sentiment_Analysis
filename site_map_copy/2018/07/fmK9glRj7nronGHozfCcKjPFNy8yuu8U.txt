(CNN) Dozens of wildfires tore across wide swaths of Alaska, California, Colorado and other western states Wednesday, with meteorologists warning of more blazes due to strong winds, dry conditions and low humidity.About 70 fires are now consuming around 630,000 acres, from Alaska -- where 19 large blazes were reported -- to California, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah, where at least six wildfires continue to burn in each state, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. Officials say there has been a decrease in the amount of acreage burning because some fires are being contained.More than 13,000 fire personnel are battling the blazes across the region, Jennifer Jones, spokeswoman for the National Interagency Fire Center told CNN.The risk of new fires throughout the drought-stricken Western US remains high amid the expected use of fireworks by revelers over the Fourth of July holiday.Ed Delgaldo, the center's national program manager for predictive services, said in a video on the agency's website that significant drought conditions across the Four Corners region -- the southwestern corner of Colorado, southeastern corner of Utah, northeastern corner of Arizona, and northwestern corner of New Mexico -- have persisted heading into the peak summer months.Read More
