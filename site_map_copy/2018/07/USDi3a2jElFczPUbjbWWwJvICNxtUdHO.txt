(CNN) The US Coast Guard extended the required safety zone surrounding active lava flows in Hawaii after a flying hunk of lava hit a tour boat and injured 23 people.The so-called lava bomb punctured the roof of a lava tour boat named Hot Shot on Monday morning in Kapoho Bay on Hawaii's Big Island, the Hawaii County Fire Department said.A flying hunk of lava tore a hole in the roof of a lava tour boat Monday in Hawaii's Kapoho Bay.Boats in Hawaii were already required to be at least 300 meters, or nearly 1,000 feet, away from lava flows at all times, the Coast Guard said. However, certain commercial and research vessels were granted special permission to approach closer.These boats were allowed to be up to 100 meters (330 feet) away, and last week, the Coast Guard lowered that safety zone to 50 (164 feet) meters, according to Matthew West, a Coast Guard spokesman.But in the wake of the lava bomb injuries, the Coast Guard said all boats must adhere to the 300-meter rule.Read More
