"It bothers me. I've lived and breathed it for many, many years."Valenzuela-Reyes' ex-wife and children have lived in Atlanta, and he also has family in Santiago, Chile, where he may be living under a false identify and where new FBI posters are being distributed, the agency said.ValuJet Flight 592
