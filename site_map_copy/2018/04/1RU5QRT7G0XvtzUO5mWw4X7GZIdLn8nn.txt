(CNN) The Hart family packed up and left their home in Washington state shortly after a worker from child protective services visited, a neighbor told the department, according to a case report released Friday.The parents and three children were found dead three days later, on March 26, after their SUV went over a cliff in California. Three other children are missing, but presumed dead.The report and other case notes from the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services gives additional details into the family's life in Woodland.After one of the children came by asking for food on March 23, the neighbor contacted authorities, who sent an investigator by the home late that afternoon. That first report indicated that the agency acted because it believed the "living situation is immediately dangerous or unhealthy."The family's SUV was in the driveway but no one answered the front or back door. The investigator left a business card in the front door, the case notes say.
