(CNN) Crowds grew silent Wednesday evening as bells rang out 39 times in Atlanta and Memphis, Tennessee, to mark the age of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at the time of his assassination.Cities across the United States honored King with ceremonies and performances, as well as reflections on what today's civil rights advocates can do to carry forward his legacy 50 years after his death.Speakers challenged listeners to push for justice and equality, as they expect King would have today.King's eldest son, Martin III, said that recent movements, including Black Lives Matter, #MeToo and the campaign against gun violence, led by students who survived a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, give him hope."I think that Dad and Mom would be very proud to see this group exists," he said of the youth activism.King's youngest child, Bernice, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that her father would be making connections with these movements, ensuring they got what they needed in terms of planning and organizational strategy.Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington's nonvoting delegate to Congress, said at a wreath-laying ceremony at his memorial near the National Mall that King would want people to focus on the "here and now."The most authentic way to honor my father is to commit to the work of creating a more peaceful, just, humane world. Let quotes coincide with conscious efforts to eradicate poverty, militarism and racism (privilege + power = oppressive policies + culture). #MLK50Forward #MLK pic.twitter.com/exUAp1E68q â€” Be A King (@BerniceKing) April 4, 2018Perhaps the grandest, most-sweeping memorial was in Memphis, where King was slain while standing on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel.speeches, videos, and singing and spoken-word performances -- was largely held in the courtyard of the motel, now home to the The daylong tribute there -- which featuredspeeches, videos, and singing and spoken-word performances -- was largely heldin the courtyard of the motel, now home to the National Civil Rights MuseumSome people at the event held signs reading, "I am a man."

Michael Pfleger , a Catholic priest and activist against street violence on Chicago's South Side, told the crowd that King's "loyalty was to God, and his faith is what summoned him to his activism.""Dr. King was uncompromising in his commitment to eradicate war and racism and poverty, Pfleger said."Martin Luther King Jr. was uncompromising in his charge to subpoena the conscience of America, and demand that America stand before the seat of morality and face her hypocrisy and make good on the promises that she put down on paper," he added.Pfleger said King believed the church ought to be "dangerous, dangerous to evil, dangerous to injustice."The historic Clayborn Temple bell rings in Memphis, Tennessee.So, as King stood on a motel balcony, "evil and the forces of hate sought to stop him and shut him up only to find out that a bullet could silence his voice but not his message, nor the truth that lived in him," Pfleger said.The activist challenged the crowd to not just simply remember King and "relegate his life to some nostalgic or historic event, and then continue on with business as usual.""Because if we do, then we become the present day co-conspirators of his assassination."As he wrapped up his speech, the bell from the historic Clayborn Temple rang 39 times as part of the International Moment of Reflection. Then, a person in the crowd yelled, "Let freedom ring."When the bell stopped ringing, Pfleger and Jackson helped place a red and yellow wreath on the balcony.Photos: The legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. The Rev.
