(CNN) The Federal Aviation Administration on Friday ordered new inspection requirements for engines similar to the one that failed earlier in the week on a Southwest Airlines flight, resulting in a passenger's death.The emergency airworthiness directive will require airlines to perform an ultrasonic inspection of certain CFM56-7B engines within 20 days of receipt of the order, it said. Federal safety investigators have said the naked eye cannot detect the cracks and signs of metal fatigue that doomed the engine on Southwest Flight 1380."We are issuing this AD because we evaluated all the relevant information and determined the unsafe condition described previously is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design," the directive said.The Southwest Boeing 737 took off Tuesday morning from New York, headed for Dallas.
