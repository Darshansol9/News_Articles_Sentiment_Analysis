Miami (CNN) Broward County sheriff's deputies took a largely symbolic vote of no confidence against embattled Sheriff Scott Israel, but their leader says he plans to press the issue with Florida Gov. Rick Scott and ask him to reconsider the sheriff's position.The Broward Sheriff's Office Deputies Association vote was 534-94, with union President Jeff Bell vowing to ask Scott to consider removing Israel and praising the "great courage" of members who voted "under threat of retaliation and reprisal.""I cannot tell Gov. Scott how to do his job, but I'm asking him ... to re-evaluate the position of sheriff," Bell said. "If he feels that Sheriff Israel must be removed or suspended, we will fully support him in that decision."Bell said it was the union's first vote of no confidence against a sheriff."He fails to listen to the people," he said of Israel. "He fails to listen to the membership and he wants to blame everybody else for his problems."Read More
