(CNN) McKayla Maroney questioned whether or not her star gymnastics career "was really even worth it" because of the fallout from her sexual abuse at the hands of team doctor Larry Nassar, she said Tuesday."I wasn't listened to, cared about or believed, and all of those things need to be weeded out of society, because that's where things went wrong," she said.McKayla Maroney addresses a luncheon for a child abuse prevention organization Tuesday in New York.Maroney, now 22, won gold and silver at the 2012 Olympics as part of the USA Gymnastics team known as the "Fierce Five."But that success came at a cost. Nassar, the USA Gymnastics doctor, began abusing her when she was 13. The abuse continued at the Olympics and stopped only when she left the sport, Maroney said last year
