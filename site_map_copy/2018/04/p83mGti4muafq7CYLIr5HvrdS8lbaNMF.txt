A federal judge said Cohen, President Trump's personal lawyer , could review items seized when the FBI raided his home, office and hotel room for material that might be covered by attorney-client privilege. But the judge is still considering letting prosecutors allow independent investigators -- a so-called "taint team" -- also go over the material. Cohen's and Trump's lawyers don't want that.There was the expected sideshow of Stormy Daniels sitting in the audience for all of this, but there was also the unexpected jolt of Sean Hannity into the case. The Fox News host is Cohen's mystery third client , and there were audible gasps in the courtroom when Hannity's name was revealed. Hannity -- who went berserk over the Cohen raid last week without revealing his connection to the attorney -- said Cohen never represented him and they only talked briefly about real estate. Then, of course, he blamed the media. CNN's Brian Stelter says this is a big problem for FoxJUST WATCHED Sean Hannity's 'bromance' with Trump Replay More Videos ...
