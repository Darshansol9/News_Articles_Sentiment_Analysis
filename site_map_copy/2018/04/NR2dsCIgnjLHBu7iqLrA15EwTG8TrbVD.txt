(CNN) If you think students are done protesting gun violence, get ready for the National School Walkout .On Friday morning, students from more than 2,500 schools across the country will stream out of class to demand lawmakers take action.While the theme is familiar, this event is different. Here's what you need to know about Friday's student-led movement:Why is this happening Friday?April 20 is the anniversary of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre in Colorado, where 12 students and a teacher were killed.That mass shooting took place 19 years ago, before today's high schoolers were even born.But many students -- including current Columbine students -- say their lives have been shaped by sporadic school massacres, and not enough has been done to help prevent them.What exactly will happen Friday?At 10 a.m. in each time zone, students will walk out and observe a moment of silence for shooting victims.What happens after that will be up to each school's walkout leaders.One sample agenda suggests marching to a local lawmaker's office; allowing open-mic time for students to share concerns; and helping register those who are eligible to vote."For the rest of the day," the sample agenda reads, "students won't return to class, but will make calls to their Senators' offices and flood social media with calls for reform."Who started this?She was disturbed by her own reaction -- or lack thereof -- to the February massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida."When I found out about the shooting at MSD, I remember I didn't have a huge reaction. And because of that, I knew I needed to change myself, and we needed to change this country," Lane said."We should be horrified, and we're not anymore. It's American culture."What are the goals of this walkout?"Empowering students to do the walkouts and become leaders in their communities, speaking up when they see inaction," Lane said.The movement also encourages young people to push for legislation at the state level if Congress doesn't act."The federal government can set standards and practices that apply to all states around gun safety. But states have the option of passing additional measures to protect their own residents from gun violence," the website says.JUST WATCHED David Hogg: The people in power are shaking Replay More Videos ...
