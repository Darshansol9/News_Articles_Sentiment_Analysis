(CNN) To some people on the East Coast, California's devastating wildfires may seem a world away. But on Monday the skies over New York City carried a grim reminder of the blazes' massive reach.According to imaging from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association , plumes of smoke from the massive Camp Fire and other wildfires have traveled more than 3,000 miles in a long arc from California to the Northeast US and even out into the Atlantic.Photos of New York City on Monday evening confirmed the smoke is indeed visible, casting a hazy pall over the skyline.Wow. I knew tonight's sunset over New York City seemed different, and I should've realized! Wildfire smoke is in the air, all the way from California.

But so does the time of day.
