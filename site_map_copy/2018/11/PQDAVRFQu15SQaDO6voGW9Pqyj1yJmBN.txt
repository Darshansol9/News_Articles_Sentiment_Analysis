War strategyCould the US lose a war against China or Russia? It might, according to a new report from a bipartisan panel of military experts. The report warns that the Trump administration's new National Defense Strategy doesn't have enough resources , which puts the country at greater risk of losing a military conflict with the Chinese or the Russians. Meantime, the administration is thinking about a cut to the defense budget to help deal with the ballooning federal deficit. But the report warns that Russia and China are bolstering their own military capabilities, possibly putting the US military in a situation where it would "suffer unacceptably high casualties" and "struggle to win or perhaps lose, a war."JUST WATCHED New arms race brewing between US and Russia Replay More Videos ...

Weather"Oh, the weather outside is frightful ..." Yes, it's a little early for Christmas tunes, but the weather really is frightening if you live in the South or on the East Coast. A big storm coming up from the Gulf of Mexico is marching north, bringing lots of rain and flooding to the Southeast and snow from Arkansas to Maine over the next few days. Nearly 25 million are under a flood or flash flood watch from Georgia to Virginia, where heavy rain on top of already saturated soil could bring flooding. The heaviest snow will hit the central Appalachians into New England, where more than 6 inches is expected.JUST WATCHED Floods pose more health risks than you may think Replay More Videos ...
