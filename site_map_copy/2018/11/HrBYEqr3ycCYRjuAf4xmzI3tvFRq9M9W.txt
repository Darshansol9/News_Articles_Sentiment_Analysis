Volunteers have been stationed at the parking lot, handing out everything from smoke masks to dog food to clothes and other essentials.Authorities are working to relocate the estimated hundreds of wildfire evacuees living in the parking lot 10 minutes down the hill from the town of Paradise, which is now little more than acres of charred ruins.Major wildfires in California have destroyed a record number of buildings and displaced more than 300,000 people.
