(CNN) A Wisconsin school district will not punish students who were photographed last spring while appearing to give the Nazi salute, a district official said.The photo showing a group of male, mostly white high school students in the Baraboo School District with their arms raised sparked an investigation by police and the school district, along with criticism from a Holocaust memorial group.The picture, which was tagged #Barabooproud, was originally posted on the @GoBaraboo parody account with the caption, "We even got the black kid to throw it up." It has since been taken down.In a recent letter to parents and the community, Baraboo School District Administrator Lori M. Mueller said the district made the decision after a 10-day review. She said district officials are unclear about some key details surrounding the photograph despite their efforts."As previously stated, we cannot know the intentions in the hearts of those who were involved. Moreover, because of students' First Amendment rights, the district is not in a position to punish the students for their actions," Mueller said in the letter, which Baraboo School Board of Education President Kevin Vodak shared with CNN.The photo of students posted to #BarabooProud is not reflective of the educational values and beliefs of the School District of Baraboo. The District will pursue any and all available and appropriate actions, including legal, to address. â€” Lori M. Mueller (@LoriMMueller) November 12, 2018Read More
