(CNN) Kansas officials have sent letters to 731 drivers asking them to turn in license plates that include the letter combination "J-A-P," which spells out a derogatory term offensive to Japanese Americans.The plates' letters were generated by computer, said Rachel Whitten, a spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Revenue.The system will be restricted from using those letters together in the future, she said."We take these types of complaints very seriously and appreciate that it was brought to our attention," Whitten said in a statement.Car owners will be able to exchange their plates for free. Those who don't do it now will be issued new plates when their tags come up for annual renewal.Read More
