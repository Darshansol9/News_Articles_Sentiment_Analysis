A family of four found dead at their mansion in Colts Neck, New Jersey, were the victims of homicide and their house was subsequently set on fire, Monmouth County Prosecutor Christopher Gramiccioni said. Gramiccioni also said authorities are investigating a separate house fire in nearby Ocean Township as arson and are looking into whether the two fires are related.
