(CNN) The "secret archives" of a Catholic priest accused of sexual abuse were the subject of a search warrant executed Wednesday at the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston in Texas, according to a prosecutor.The warrant is the fourth executed in the investigation of abuse allegations against the Rev. Manuel LaRosa-Lopez, who was accused of sexually abusing an unnamed woman in Conroe, Texas, in 2000. The woman's father reported the alleged abuse to the church before the family left the country, and LaRosa-Lopez was moved from the parish, according to the arrest warrant filed in September.The Rev. Manuel LaRosa-Lopez faces four counts of indecency with a child.Investigators with the Conroe Police Department, Texas Rangers, Montgomery County District Attorney's Office and other agencies on Wednesday sought documents, records, electronics and other evidence from the archdiocese in the investigation of LaRosa-Lopez."We do believe, based on our research, that there will be a secret archive that will have information on this case," J. Tyler Dunman, special crimes bureau chief for the Montgomery County District Attorney, told CNN.The archdiocese in a statement said it "continues to cooperate, as we have since the outset" with investigators, adding that the cooperation was "consistent with Cardinal (Daniel) DiNardo's pledge of full cooperation."Read More
