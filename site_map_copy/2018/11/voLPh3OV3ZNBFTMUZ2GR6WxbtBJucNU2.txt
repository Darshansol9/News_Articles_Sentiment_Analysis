(CNN) In one day, the number of people unaccounted for in Northern California's Camp Fire fell by 307 while the death toll increased by two, authorities said.Nearly two weeks after the Golden State's deadliest and most destructive fire began, 563 people are still unaccounted for, Butte County Sheriff and Coroner Kory Honea said. Authorities started with a list of roughly 2,052 people and worked around the clock to identify the dead and account for survivors so they can focus on getting people back into their homes, he said.News of two more deaths brought the total number of people killed in the Camp Fire to 83. Of the 83 sets of recovered remains, 58 of them have been tentatively identified, Honea said. He identified six people by name in Wednesday's news conference.The updated figures come as Northern California contends with much-needed precipitation that could also bring flash floods and mudslides to towns charred by the devastating Camp Fire.Almost 1 million people are under flash flood watch in that part of California, where 4 to 6 inches of rain are expected to fall through Friday. Rain began in Paradise late Wednesday morning, dropping nearly an inch by late afternoon.
