Neither suffered gunshot wounds.A third person was transported to the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore, according to Lisa Clough, a hospital spokeswoman.The suspectJarrod Warren Ramos, 38, has been charged with five counts of first-degree murder, according to court records.At a Friday hearing, a judge ordered that Ramos be held without bail, according to Anne Arundel County State's Attorney Wes Adams.Adams said at a press conference there was evidence that Ramos took a tactical approach to the shooting and barricaded a rear entrance in the building before opening fire.Ramos worked his way through the office, hunting and shooting victims, Adams said, including one person who tried to escape through a back door."I'll say this," Altomare said, "the fellow was there to kill as many people as he could kill."JUST WATCHED Official: Suspect was found hiding under desk Replay More Videos ...

A picture of Ramos was run through the Maryland Image Repository System, he said, and authorities were subsequently able to identify him.Altomare said reports that Ramos had altered his fingerprints were incorrect. CNN previously reported information from two law enforcement sources who said that the suspect's fingerprints appeared to have been altered, making it difficult to identify him that way.JUST WATCHED Witness describes seeing shooter Replay More Videos ...
