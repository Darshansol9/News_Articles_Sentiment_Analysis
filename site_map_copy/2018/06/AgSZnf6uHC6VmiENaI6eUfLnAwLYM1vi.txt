Several groups shut down highways and intersections across the city during several days of protest."Three shots in the back. How you justify that?" protesters chanted.The protests were put on hold Monday to allow the family to mourn.

I want my mom to never feel that pain."An obituary described him as a well-traveled teen who took honors classes and loved to play basketball, surf and skate."Antwon was a beautiful, bright, charming and generous person and volunteered his time at and services to the (The Free Store) in Braddock," the program says.He had appeared briefly in a campaign commercial for John Fetterman, who is running for lieutenant governor in Pennsylvania. His wife, Gisele Fetterman owns and operates Free Store 15104, where Antwon had volunteered, and Gisele Fetterman spoke at his funeral."He looked you in the eyes and gave anyone speaking to him total attention and respect," Fetterman said in her tribute to Antwon. "He would look at you with his big sweet smile, and you would feel, deep in your heart, that this was someone who would make the world better.""Antwon's death shakes my heart, it rattles my faith that things will ever get better or that injustices will ever end. Slowly, too slowly, things will get brighter, even though they're now so dark," she said.Media were not allowed inside, but reporters could clearly see the parking lot was filled to capacity. A motorcade carrying some of Antwon's family members arrived with a police vehicle from Rankin, where Antwon lived, bringing up the rear. Fifteen minutes after the service began, mourners continued to arrive and enter the school.As mourners -- some of whom have been attending the protests -- left the funeral around 1 p.m., they shouted to the assembled media outside. "Say his name!" said one. Another cried, "Justice for my cousin!" Some held their fists in the air as they left the school.'Ready to fight'"I am in amazement that this all has something to do with my son, but I'm destroyed by the reason why. I appreciate all the protesters, but I just want them to protest peacefully," Antwon's mother Michelle Kenney said in an exclusive interview with ABC that aired Monday.On Sunday, mourners gathered for Antwon's wake."Today has been a particularly difficult day because the finality begins to set in, when you see your son laid out, embalmed and lifeless," Lee Merritt, the attorney for Antwon's family, said Sunday. "Tomorrow will be a more difficult day."His parents are in shock over the death of their son, but also frustrated by the media reports on his character. They're also upset the officer who shot Antwon hasn't been charged, Merritt said."They're ready to fight," Merritt said of Antwon's parents. "In the coming weeks, you're going to hear a lot more from them. They're like the protesters. They're not going anywhere. They have a lot to say."Teen's mom: 'He murdered my son'Antwon was a passenger in the car, which authorities suspected of being involved in a shooting earlier in the day on June 19, Allegheny County police said.The officer ordered the driver out of the car and onto the ground, police said.
