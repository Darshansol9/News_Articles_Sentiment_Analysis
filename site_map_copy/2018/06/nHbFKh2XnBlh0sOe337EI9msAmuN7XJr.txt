(CNN) Millennials aren't using their vacation days. Combined, they command more than $1.3 trillion in annual spending. And FOMO -- fear of missing out -- pushes them toward experiences over material things.So why not put all that time and money toward a vacation in space?According to a Pew Research Center study released Wednesday, a majority of this younger generation of Americans -- 63% -- would be up for it.Millennials, who are now in their 20s and 30s, are the generation most interested in space tourism , the study found. The idea attracted only about four in 10 Gen Xers, who are between about 38 and 53 years old, and 27% of Baby Boomers or older generations of Americans.The most common reason given for wanting to go was a desire to do something unique.
