(CNN) Protests along the US-Mexico border heated up again Monday as thousands of undocumented migrant children remained separated from their parents.One of the main protests is taking place in the Texas border city of Tornillo, the site of a temporary shelter for unaccompanied migrant children.Another protest is happening outside the US Border Patrol Central Processing Center in McAllen, Texas. There, demonstrators held signs such as "Parents Everywhere Care" and "Free Them."Protesters gathered Monday to denounce the separation of migrant children and their parents.After widespread criticism over family separations caused by President Donald Trump's "zero tolerance" policy, Trump reversed course last week by signing an executive order aimed at keeping some families together at the border.But it did little to calm the outrage. And on Sunday, Trump called for the deportation of people without judicial proceedings to thwart what he referred to as an invasion by "these people."We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country. When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came. Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order. Most children come without parents... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2018....Our Immigration policy, laughed at all over the world, is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years! Immigration must be based on merit - we need people who will help to Make America Great Again! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2018
