(CNN) Larry Nassar's former boss, William Strampel, was in a Michigan court Tuesday facing charges related and unrelated to the disgraced former doctor for the US women's gymnastics team.A judge decided there was enough evidence that Strampel, the former dean of Michigan State University's College of Osteopathic Medicine, should face trial on charges that include sexual misconduct and willful neglect of duty.He had been charged in March after four female students accused him of using his power to sexually assault, harass and solicit nude photos of them, according to court documents.He also faces a misdemeanor count of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct for his actions as dean from 2002 to 2018 and two misdemeanor charges of willful neglect of duty related to his failure to oversee Nassar properly, according to court documents. He has pleaded not guilty.A judge at his preliminary examination in East Lansing District Court set his next appearance for June 20.
