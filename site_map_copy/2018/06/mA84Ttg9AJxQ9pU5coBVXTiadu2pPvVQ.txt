(CNN) "The Dancing Doctor" has agreed to give up her medical license for at least two and a half years, according to an agreement filed Friday with the Georgia Composite Medical Board.The consent order signed by Windell Boutte, a board-certified dermatologist, says that her license to practice medicine in Georgia is indefinitely suspended, but after two and a half years she can petition to have the suspension lifted.She cannot use the title "doctor" or engage in the practice of medicine during her suspension, the document says, and will drop her own court case in which she seeks a temporary restraining order.The publicist team for Boutte issued this statement: "Windell Davis-Boutte respects the process and has voluntarily accepted the consent order for suspension. She is hopeful that the suspension will be lifted and she is able to practice Medicine at some point in the near future."JUST WATCHED 'Dancing doctor' says she's done nothing wrong Replay More Videos ...
