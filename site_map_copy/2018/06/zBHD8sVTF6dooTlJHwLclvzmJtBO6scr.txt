(CNN) "Happy Mother's Day" -- that's what an ICE officer mockingly told a Guatemalan woman seeking asylum in the United States right before separating her from her now-8-year-old daughter a week before Mother's Day, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday.Angelica Gonzalez-Garcia and her daughter fled Guatemala for the United States citing abuse, domestic violence and discrimination in their homeland, according to the lawsuit. At first, they were detained together in close confines with about 40 other women and children in one cell in Arizona. Less than 24 hours after they were first detained, Gonzalez-Garcia's daughter had been taken away by immigration authorities, the lawsuit says.After Gonzalez-Garcia was granted bond by an immigration judge, she flew to Massachusetts to stay with some friends, also from Guatemala. Now Gonzalez-Garcia, with the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, has filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Massachusetts against US Attorney General Jeff Sessions and various government agencies, demanding immediate reunification with her daughter."The day after I was detained, I was removed from the cell and ... told that they were going to take my daughter a long way away," said Gonzalez-Garcia at a news conference Wednesday, the day her lawsuit was filed.It was then that Gonzalez-Garcia's alleged incident with the officer unfolded. "One of the officers asked me, 'In Guatemala, do they celebrate Mother's Day?' When I answered yes, he said, 'Then Happy Mother's Day,' because the next Sunday was Mother's Day. I lowered my head so that my daughter would not see tears forming in my eyes."Read More
