(CNN) The family of the 17-year-old shot and killed by an East Pittsburgh police officer told CNN Friday they appreciate the love and support they're getting from people across the country, and they wish Antwon could have seen it."Sometimes it's overwhelming, you know, because it's like, 'That's my brother,'" Kyra Jamison explained when asked by Erica Hill about the "persistent but ... very peaceful" protests.
