(CNN) A woman in Alaska charged with murdering her two children almost two years apart searched the internet for ways to kill -- and get away with it -- before calling for medical help for her baby daughter, police in Fairbanks said.Stephany Lafountain called Fairbanks emergency services in November 2017, saying her 13-month-old child was not breathing. An hour earlier, police say, her internet searches had included "ways to suffocate," "ways to kill human with no proof," and "How to: Commit the Perfect Murder."The child was rushed to a hospital but died four days later.While investigating, police found that in September 2015, Lafountain also had called for help when her then 4-month-old child, also a girl, was not breathing.
