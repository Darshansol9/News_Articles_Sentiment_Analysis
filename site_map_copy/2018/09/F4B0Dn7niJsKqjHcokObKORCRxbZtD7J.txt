(CNN) Cardinal Donald Wuerl, perhaps the most powerful Catholic cleric in the United States, acknowledged the disquiet and turmoil surrounding his leadership -- as well as the Catholic Church as a whole -- amid a wave of multi-state abuse-related investigations that has shaken the church to its core.Wuerl, the archbishop of Washington, D.C., wrote of an unholy trinity of tension requiring a six-week "season of healing" in a letter sent to his priests on Thursday."Among the many observations was that the archdiocese would be well served by new leadership to help move beyond the current confusion, disappointment and disunity," wrote Wuerl, who met in secret with Pope Francis last month to discuss the crisis. A source told CNN that the pontiff advised Wuerl, a close ally, to consult with his priests about his future.Just days after that meeting in Rome, Wuerl returned to Washington where, with no apparent intention of resigning, he pledged transparency and accountability in a public mass."As we move forward I hope to lead by action, not just by words," he said.Now, as he struggles to regain his footing, some are calling into question the motives of the man they say has a history of inaction when it comes to the type of reform he's now pledging to seek."Such a phony," said David Lorenz, a clerical sex abuse survivor who lives in Maryland."I've heard those words before, heard them a hundred times. There's nothing there."At least two of those times, according to Lorenz, were in private meetings he had with the then-newly minted cardinal in 2006.JUST WATCHED PA AG: Church officials knew about assault Replay More Videos ...

"If people reflect on his full record and the facts, they will see that."His full record has come under new scrutiny in the wake of a damning grand jury investigation in Pennsylvania. Wuerl, who served as the bishop of Pittsburgh for nearly 20 years before ascending to Washington in 2006, is painted as having a checkered record when it came to protecting known predator priests.JUST WATCHED Officials investigate clergy sex abuse claims Replay More Videos ...

And since arriving in Washington in 2006, the now-cardinal has been pressed to do so for several years by the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP.JUST WATCHED Priest: This should never happen to any child Replay More Videos ...

Why don't you publish the names?"And as for whether he feels he's been "sacramentally healed," as Wuerl suggested, Lorenz scoffed."Ecclesiastical B.S."
