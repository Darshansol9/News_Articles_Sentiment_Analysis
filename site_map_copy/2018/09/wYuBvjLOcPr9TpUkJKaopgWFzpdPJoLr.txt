(CNN) The battered Hawaiian Islands have managed to keep tourism dollars coming in despite an ongoing volcanic eruption, earthquakes, hurricanes and flooding, according to figures released Thursday.Hawaii's 2018 woes began with flooding on Kauai in April, followed by earthquakes and eruptions of lava and volcanic gases caused by the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii Island. The state then fell victim to flooding from rains brought by Hurricane Lane and Tropical Storm Olivia."Despite the challenges of Kilauea volcano and Hurricane Lane, the State of Hawaii realized a good summer travel season, as combined visitor spending for the months of June, July and August totaled $4.67 billion, an increase of 5.5% over last year, with visitor arrivals reaching nearly 2.7 million, an increase of 5.3%," president and CEO of the Hawaii Tourism Authority George D. Szigeti said in a statement."Although both visitor spending and arrivals increased in August compared to a year ago, we expected better results for this peak travel month. Hurricane Lane deterred a segment of travelers from staying in the Hawaiian Islands, which was compounded by the continuing negative effect Kilauea volcano had on the island of Hawaii," he said.
