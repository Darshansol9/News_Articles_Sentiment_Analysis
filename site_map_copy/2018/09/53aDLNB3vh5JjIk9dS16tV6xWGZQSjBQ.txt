Darryl Clinton never got a chance to spot the flaming lava bomb falling from the sky before it hit his leg and set him on fire."It basically snapped my leg in half, but right above the ankle" he told CNN. "So my foot and my ankle were hanging by basically the back of my flesh, maybe my Achilles was still there. But all the other stuff was severed, so I had to hold my shoe.""I hit the ground to escape the fire, so I had to hold my shoe up and my leg up vertical and just keep my bottom part of my leg attached to the top."Clinton said he was talking on his cell phone when he saw the soccer ball-sized lava bomb — a flying chunk of molten rock — hit him in the leg while he was on the porch."I was in horrible pain. And it looked so hideous," he said. "It's the worst thing I've ever seen happen to me in my life."Doctors worked on his leg and removed all the rocks and debris from his wound.Clinton thought he was going to die."I thought at the very minimum I would have to lose a foot," he said. "I thought I was going to die, but I didn't even think I'd have a foot."Watch more:
