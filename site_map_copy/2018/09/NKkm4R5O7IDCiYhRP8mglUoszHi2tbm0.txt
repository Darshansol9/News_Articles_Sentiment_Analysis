(CNN) As Paul Flaherty flew over Hurricane Florence, he didn't like what he was seeing.The storm was getting stronger and stronger. It grew from a tropical storm to a Category 4 hurricane in 72 hours.Flaherty, flight director for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Hurricane Hunters, saw the eye wall forming. He felt a sick feeling in his gut."It just kind of hits you in the gut when you see this thing strengthening and know that the forecast is calling for it to come in as such a strong storm," he told CNN on Monday after his third flight. "We don't like what we're seeing. I don't think you guys like much what you're seeing on the ground either."Hurricane hunters have monitored the storm from above over the last few days as it churns toward the southern East Coast of the United States. Hurricane Florence neared Category 5 strength on Monday, forcing evacuations in coastal areas in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.
