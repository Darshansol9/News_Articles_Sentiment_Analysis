(CNN) The father who lost track of his autistic son during a visit to a Gastonia, North Carolina, park said Wednesday he's overwhelmed with guilt as the search for the boy enters day five."Everybody looks at you as a monster, and I regretted it since the moment it happened," Ian Ritch told "Good Morning America."Ritch said he had his eyes on young Maddox, but the 6-year-old suddenly dropped out of view Saturday.
