(CNN) Residents in a community north of St. Louis got some news this week they've longed wanted to hear. Radioactive material -- from the Manhattan Project -- will be removed from an area landfill.The Environmental Protection Agency announced cleanup plans Thursday for the material in the West Lake Landfill Superfund Site in Bridgeton, Missouri. The 200-acre site, about 20 miles northwest of downtown St. Louis and a mile and half east of the Missouri River, holds materials contaminated by uranium ore. The uranium was processed as part of the Manhattan Project, the US government's massive research and development program during World War II that led to the creation of nuclear weapons.The site had been used as a landfill since the 1950s but became tainted in 1973 when 39,000 tons of soil mixed with 8,700 tons of radioactive materials were dumped there."EPA made a commitment to the people of Missouri to finalize a cleanup plan for the West Lake Landfill Superfund site, and today we are delivering on that commitment," EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said Thursday at a news conference"The improvements we've made in our final remedy will speed up construction time by a year and reduce exposure to the community and cleanup workers while still removing virtually the same total amount of radioactivity."Read More
