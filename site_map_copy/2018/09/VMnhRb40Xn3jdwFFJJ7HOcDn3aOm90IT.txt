"My home is all my wife and I have, materially speaking, a lifetime of stuff." They say their house is about 20 feet above sea level.Terman, who said his wife already had plans to take a trip, will make his final decision Wednesday.Latest developmentsâ€¢ As of 8 p.m. ET Tuesday, Florence's center had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph and was about 725 miles east-southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina.â€¢ The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for the coast from to Duck, North Carolina, and the Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds, to the South Santee River, South Carolina. Hurricane warnings are issued 36 hours before tropical storm force winds hit the areas, and indicate hurricane conditions will follow.â€¢ Florence strengthened Tuesday, though it should weaken to a Category 3 storm by landfall around Friday morning, likely in the Carolinas, forecasts show.â€¢ Still, it will "be an extremely dangerous major hurricane" through landfall, the National Hurricane Center said.â€¢ President Trump declared an emergency in North Carolina, allowing it to access federal funds. "I think that any amounts of money, whatever it takes, we're going to do," Trump said.â€¢ Later this week, life-threatening storm surges -- up to 13 feet -- are expected along the coasts, and up to 35 inches of rain could fall through early next week over parts of the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic states.â€¢ The storm's center may move very slowly inland -- meaning rain for days in some places. "This thing is going to stop, and it's going to rain -- and it's going to rain. ... We could see 3 feet," CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said Tuesday afternoon.Mandatory evacuations have been ordered for most of the South Carolina coastline, in Edisto Beach as well as from Charleston County northeast to Horry County. They've also been ordered for parts of coastal North Carolina and Virginia.â€¢ The state of North Carolina lists 20 shelters open in eastern counties. It also said prisoners from four jails have been moved farther inland.â€¢ North Carolina-based Lowe's home improvement stores say the most popular items right now are generators, chainsaw, buckets, trash bags, tarps, plywood and gas cans.The residents of this home in Southport, North Carolina, indicate they are going to ride out the storm.â€¢ Powerful storm surges and winds will pose deadly threats, as will long periods of heavy rain. Beyond the Carolinas and Virginia , the threat of flooding extends into next week to parts of Georgia, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, West Virginia, forecasters said.Residents prepare to flee and hunker down"This will be a storm that creates and causes massive damage to our country," Jeff Byard, Federal Emergency Management Agency associate administrator, said Tuesday."It is going to be ... a long-term recovery," Byard said. "This is not going to be a storm that we recover from in days."Residents along the coast boarded up their homes, formed long lines at gas stations and emptied the shelves of hardware stores and supermarkets this week as they prepared for Florence's arrival.On Ocracoke Island along North Carolina's Outer Banks, Kelley Shinn's partner woke her up at 3 a.m. Tuesday and told her to pack. He figured the forecasts were too ominous to stay.They and their 12-year-old packed her Jeep with clothes and other things, and within hours, they took a ferry to the mainland, then struck out for her father's home in Ohio."It's surreal to think we may have nothing to go home to," she told CNN. " ... We've never left for a storm before. But a storm surge of 20 feet could easily wipe this island out."John McGowan, a resident of a town just west of Wilmington, said Tuesday he planned on staying through the storm -- but filled his vehicle with gas in case he changes his mind."I'll make an evaluation tomorrow (Wednesday) afternoon. If that thing is still coming at us at about 120 mph, I may change my mind," he said.Evacuation orders in effect for coastal areas of NC. But before leaving... Carolina Beach residents are waiting in line to get ID cards so they can get back on the island after the storm. Folks told line moving slow bc 4 workers already evacuated.
