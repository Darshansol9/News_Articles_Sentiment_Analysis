"And now I am living with a lot of dogs and always have a plan."Zenna said about 16 people across the US donated to help Meinhold. Initially, the group planned to purchase a 2009 Dodge Journey with the help of a generous single $5,200 donation, Zenna said.When that plan fell through, a U-Haul van was rented.Pictures shared on Facebook show Meinhold and her dogs on their journey away from Florence's path.Big Fluffy Dog RescueA team from Big Fluffy Dog Rescue drove more than 20 hours to retrieve the animals at a shelter in Pawleys island."Luckily, we had some awesome volunteers meet us at our kennel facility to help unload, walk, feed and settle all the fur kids in," Tiffany Carol Fintel, a Nashville vet technician, told CNN.Fintel said that Big Fluffy is not equipped for cats, but the founder of the rescue, Jean Harrison, has a "no animal left behind" policy so they picked up kittens, too."If there had been pigs or even a duck she would have told me to take them, too," she said.
