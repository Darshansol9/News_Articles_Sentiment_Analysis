(CNN) More than 3,000 cases of marijuana smoking and possession were dismissed Wednesday in Manhattan, the latest example of New York City officials relaxing the marijuana enforcement policy.The 3,042 cases that were dismissed, including some that date as far back as 1978, do not include those for violent crimes, said District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., who presented the motion to dismiss in New York City Criminal Court."Outstanding warrants for these low-level cases drive law enforcement and our communities apart," Vance said. "New Yorkers with warrants face unnecessary loss of employment, housing and immigration consequences, and because many of them fear they will be arrested for an open warrant, they don't collaborate with the (New York Police Department) and district attorneys to keep our communities safe."Criminal Court Judge Kevin McGrath granted the dismissal and said the cases would be sealed in 90 days. The 90-day period allows administrations the time to file the paperwork appropriately, Vance said. The district attorney's office will now give public defender agencies the names of those whose bench warrants were just dismissed so people can find out if their cases were among those.These dismissals are the latest example of the relaxation of marijuana enforcement.Read More
