AppleToday's event was evolutionary, not revolutionary.And maybe that's okay for a trillion-dollar company that has hordes of fans awaiting every single new product. But anyone who was waiting for a surprise announcement at the end came away disappointed.From my seat in the back of the theater, this event was all about "more-more-more," meaning faster processors, more storage, better cameras.Reading between the lines, I also heard Apple execs telling us not to take these features for granted. Not to shrug off the technological achievements that we're all carrying around in our pockets.It's definitely easy to start taking this tech for granted, but Apple wants you to remember what you're paying for -- or, to put a finer point on it, WHY you're paying so much.
