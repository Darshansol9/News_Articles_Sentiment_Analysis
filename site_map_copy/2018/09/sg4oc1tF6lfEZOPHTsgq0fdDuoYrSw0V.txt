Wilmington, North Carolina (CNN) Florence has left the Carolinas, but the death toll keeps rising as remnants of the storm generate rain, floodwater and tornadoes.Now a post-tropical cyclone, Florence has killed 32 people, trapped hundreds more and cut off an entire city, officials said. Residential streets have turned into rivers, and freeways have morphed into waterways dotted with rescue boats. And the storm continues to wreak havoc.The first Florence-related death in Virginia was reported Monday as a tornado associated with the storm's outer bands caused a building to collapse near Richmond. And reports in North Carolina of two hog-farm lagoons being breached and more being inundated by flood waters are causing health concernsScott Fleenor, bottom, and Jeremiah Trendell board over the windows of a business in Myrtle Beach.Scott Fleenor, bottom, and Jeremiah Trendell board over the windows of a business in Myrtle Beach.Chuck Ledford, left, watches cartoons on a phone with his daughter Misty as they seek shelter at Emma B.

Roy Cooper said Monday. "This is an epic storm that is still continuing because the rivers are still rising."Florence will probably dump another 2 to 5 inches of rain on central and southeastern North Carolina, CNN meteorologist Michael Guy said. But even when the rain lets up, water gushing downstream is expected to cause "catastrophic and historic river flooding" for days across portions of the Carolinas, the National Weather Service said.'There will be flooding like we've never seen before'In addition to flooding across the Carolinas, flash-flood warnings were in effect Monday night across parts of far southern Virginia, where several tornadoes were confirmed Monday by storm spotters. One of those tornadoes hit Chesterfield County south of Richmond, causing a building collapse that killed one person.In North Carolina, residents are slowly being allowed back to their homes in some areas. On Tuesday morning, residents of Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina -- where Florence made landfall -- will be allowed back on the island, and Craven County's mandatory evacuation will be lifted. But officials warned that homes and roads may still not be accessible and people attempting to return should use extreme caution.This isn't a river...this is Interstate 40. @NCAviation captured this drone footage today as part of damage assessment near mile marker 387 in Pender County.

And those trapped in floodwater could also be without power for days.The situation is especially dire in Wilmington, a city so deeply submerged that no one could get in Sunday. State authorities eventually were able to open one road into the city of 117,000. But it's not for residents to use to return.Mike Pollack searches for a drain in the yard of his flooded home in Wilmington, North Carolina."We do not want evacuees to go back. There's too much going on," Cooper said.The state's Department of Transportation said it's not clear how long that road will stay open, so authorities are trying to rush in supplies. And supplies such as fuel are in critical need. The Wilmington-based Cape Fear Public Utility Authority urged residents to fill bathtubs and containers with water in case it doesn't have enough fuel to keep its water treatment plants running.Pender County, just north of Wilmington, is also running out of fuel, Commissioner Jackie Newton said.Evacuee loses car trying to get a flood victim foodWilmington evacuee James Ammons can't get a break.James AmmonsHe just moved to Wilmington a few weeks ago and already lost his car in the storm, he said."The reason why I lost my car is because there was a girl who hadn't had food, and I wanted to get her some food," Ammons said.He tried to find safety at an emergency shelter, but it got flooded out.

But he said perspective is important."You have to be grateful for what you have right now."North Carolina Task Force members search for residents Sunday in Fayetteville, North Carolina.River threatens to swallow Lumberton ... againIn Lumberton, North Carolina -- a city submerged by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 -- residents were bracing for disaster as the Lumber River seeps through a patched-up gap in the levee systemLumberton, North Carolina, is dealing with post-hurricane flooding for the second time in two years.The river is expected to crest around 25.7 feet.

But those who left without their pets faced the wrath of passers-by and social media users.Freelance journalist Marcus DiPaola tweeted that he helped rescue six dogs in Leland, North Carolina, after they were left locked in an outdoor cage."We got them out, but by the time we left, the water was so high that they would have drowned.
