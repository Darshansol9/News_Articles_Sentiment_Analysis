(CNN) This shipment of bananas donated to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice was ripe for contraband."Sometimes, life gives you lemons. Sometimes, it gives you bananas. And sometimes, it gives you something you'd never expect!," posted the department on Facebook.On Friday, department officers went to pick up two pallets of donated fruit and quickly discovered something off about the weight of the boxes."One of the sergeants just noticed one of the boxes didn't seem quite right," Jeremy Desel, department spokesperson, told CNN affiliate KTRK . "[He] looked a little further, removed that box off one of the pallets, took a look inside and saw something extraordinarily suspicious."Within the boxes, officials discovered 540 packages of cocaine hidden among bundles of bananas. Police list the value of the drugs at almost $18 million. The donation came from Port of America in Freeport, Texas, according to the department, though it's unclear who or when the cocaine entered the shipment.Read More
