Residents boarded up their homes, formed long lines at gas stations and emptied the shelves of hardware stores and supermarkets.Residents stock up on supplies at a Harris Teeter grocer in the Isle of Palms, South Carolina.The size of hurricane-force winds doubled over 12 hours from 30 to 60 miles across, the National Hurricane Center said Monday afternoon. The wind field is expected to keep growing, which will increase the storm surge and inland wind threats, the service said in a statement."None of the guidance suggest that Florence has peaked in intensity, and this is supported by a continuation of a low-shear environment, and even warmer waters over he next 36 hours. Thus, the intensity forecast is raised from the previous one, bringing Florence close to Category 5 strength tomorrow," NHS said.More counties placed under mandatory evacuations
