(CNN) Erika Pe単a is still fearful and shaken days after she managed to escape from the hands of a US Border Patrol supervisor accused of a string of killings in south Texas, her family says.The 26-year-old mother was in a pickup truck with Juan David Ortiz, a 10-year veteran of US Customs and Border Protection, on Friday when he pointed a pistol at her and she struggled with him until she was able to run away and find a state trooper, officials said."It's a miracle that she's alive," her brother Cesar Alberto Villarreal said.Authorities were able to find Ortiz with Pe単a's help and eventually they arrested him in the parking garage of a hotel. But Pe単a's family doesn't want anyone to ignore the trauma she endured."Yes, to others she is a hero, but it doesn't take away the fact that she was also a victim in this tragedy. She is a survivor but she is going through serious trauma," said Pe単a's aunt Marcela Rodriguez.Read More
