(CNN) After an agonizing week of ravaging floods, rising rivers, power outages and dozens of deaths, the Florence-weary Carolinas are facing the possibility of more flooding over the weekend.At least 44 people have died since the hurricane slammed the coast last week. While the rain has subsided, some rivers are still rising, and North and South Carolina officials warn the flooding danger is far from over."The Cape Fear River will crest again this weekend, along with the Lumber River," the North Carolina Department of Transportation tweeted Friday, adding that the Neuse will rise Monday."Additionally, new areas are flooding with little warning. Due to this, travel isn't recommended south of US 64," it said.While some roads are not flooded, they may have damage and hazardous debris that makes it dangerous to drive or walk on them, state officials said.
