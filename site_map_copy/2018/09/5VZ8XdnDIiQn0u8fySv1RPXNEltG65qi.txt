(CNN) As the monstrosity that's Hurricane Florence moves closer to the Carolinas, the Waffle House is joining the list of agencies and businesses tracking the storm's every twist and turn.The Southern breakfast chain, which is open 24 hours a day all year, activated a storm center to monitor the Category 2 hurricane . Waffle House restaurants are known for staying open during natural disasters, and federal officials use them to determine the severity of a hurricane, tornado or other hazards on a local area.The Federal Emergency Management Agency coined the term "Waffle House Index" to measure the effect of a natural disaster on an area. If a Waffle House shuts down or limits its menu after such hazards, federal officials conclude the community took a major hit."The Waffle House test just doesn't tell us how quickly a business might rebound — it also tells how the larger community is faring," FEMA said in a 2011 blog post when Craig Fugate was administrator."The sooner restaurants, grocery and corner stores, or banks can re-open, the sooner local economies will start generating revenue again — signaling a strong recovery for that community."The ⁦@WaffleHouse⁩ Storm Center is activated and monitoring #Florence.
