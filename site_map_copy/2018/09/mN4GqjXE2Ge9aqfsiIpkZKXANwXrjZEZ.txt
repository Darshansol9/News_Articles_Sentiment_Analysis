(CNN) The US Catholic bishops' conference issued a dramatic apology on Wednesday for the role of bishops in the church's clergy sexual abuse scandal and announced new initiatives to hold abusive or negligent bishops accountable."Some bishops, by their actions or their failures to act, have caused great harm to both individuals and the Church as a whole," said the administrative committee of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in a statement."They have used their authority and power to manipulate and sexually abuse others. They have allowed the fear of scandal to replace genuine concern and care for those who have been victimized by abusers."The statement from the US Catholic bishops' conference comes a week after its leadership met with Pope Francis at the Apostolic Palace in Rome. In a statement after the meeting, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the bishops' conference, called it a "lengthy, fruitful and good exchange."But in recent weeks most of the news surrounding the Catholic Church has been far from good.
