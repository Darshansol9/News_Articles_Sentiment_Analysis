The Laramie Police Department took down a Nazi flag that was raised in Washington Park in Laramie, Wyoming on Tuesday, July 31.(CNN) The flag of Nazi Germany was sighted atop a flagpole in a public park in Laramie, Wyoming.The US flag that usually flies from the pole lay crumpled on the ground when police arrived on the scene Monday morning, according to Lieutenant Gwen Smith of the Laramie Police Department.Shortly after police were notified of the incident, officers promptly removed the Nazi flag, which bore the swastika symbol. Upon retrieving the discarded American flag, the officers folded it properly and one saluted the flag as the other returned it to its rightful place atop the flagpole, Smith said.In a statement to CNN, the Anti-Defamation League said it is outraged by the incident."It is appalling and outrageous that anyone would cast aside the American flag in a public park and replace it with an ugly symbol of the Nazi regime," said Jeremy Shaver, a senior associate director with the Anti-Defamation League. "We all have a responsibility to speak up when such hateful incidents take place in our communities."Read More
