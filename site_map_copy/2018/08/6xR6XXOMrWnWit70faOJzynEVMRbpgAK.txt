Police in downtown Portland ordered protesters to disperse and leave a location where they saw people throwing projectiles, including rocks and bottles. "Failure to comply with this order may subject you to arrest or citation, and may subject you to the use of riot control agents or impact weapons," police said on Twitter and on a loudspeaker at the scene.
