(CNN) A family snorkeling in Hawaii managed to free a 20-foot whale shark from a thick, heavy piece of fishing line that was looped around its head and had been digging into its flesh for weeks.The Kawelo family was snorkeling off Kaunolu, Lanai, on July 29 when they saw the whale shark swimming. Kapua Kawelo and her husband, Joby Rohrer, are both biologists and realized it was in trouble."We waited a long time to consider what our responsibility was, what our kuleana was," Kawelo told CNN affiliate KHNL, using a Hawaiian word for "a reciprocal relationship between the person who is responsible and the thing which they are responsible for.""We know that people don't necessarily encourage this type of thing, but both of us are biologists," she said. "We felt like we were, sort of, in tune with what the animal was doing and maybe we were meant to be there."So, they decided to help -- not realizing the juvenile whale shark, which first had been spotted on July 11, had been growing emaciated as the entanglement threatened its life , according to the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources.Read More
