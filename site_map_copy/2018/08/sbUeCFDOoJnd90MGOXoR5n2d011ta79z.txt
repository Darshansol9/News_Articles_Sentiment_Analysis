(CNN) An ailing and emaciated orca named Scarlet could get food and antibiotics soon -- if biologists can find her before it's too late.Scarlet is among a group of endangered, rapidly dwindling Southern Resident killer whales that frequent the Pacific Northwest.US biologists are racing to find the underweight 3-year-old animal to administer antibiotics either through food or by injection, but she could be dead or in Canada.Scarlet, also known as J50, was last seen in Canadian waters Saturday, on the west side of Vancouver Island. The 3-year-old orca's condition is so poor, she may not survive and is running out of time, scientists said. She is underweight and lethargic with periods of inactivity, and does not appear to be feeding.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said its effort will involve shooting antibiotics in the orca to aid with recovery and using a local tribe to feed them fish that has medicine, a rare practice that has not been tried in the wild before.Read More
