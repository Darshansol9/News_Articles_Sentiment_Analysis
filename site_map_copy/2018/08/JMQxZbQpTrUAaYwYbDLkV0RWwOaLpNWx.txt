(CNN) A black New York state senator who says a woman called 911 on him for campaigning has introduced a bill to punish people for making racially motivated police reports.Earlier this month, state Sen. Jesse Hamilton was campaigning in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, when a woman who Hamilton said didn't agree with his criticism of President Donald Trump called 911 when Hamilton refused to leave the public street corner. "I said 'I'm not leaving.' She said, 'I'm going to call the police.' I thought she was joking," Hamilton said.Hamilton hopes to pass legislation making these types of reports a crime in New York. "My civil rights were violated and other peoples' civil rights are being violated. We have to make sure people understand you can't call the police on someone who isn't doing anything wrong," he said.The proposed bill would require the local district attorney to investigate these incidents as hate crimes. If a report is determined to be racially motivated, the district attorney would then recommend one of a number of consequences, including fines, sensitivity training or jail time.Read More
