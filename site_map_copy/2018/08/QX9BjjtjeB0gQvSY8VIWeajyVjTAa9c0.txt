(CNN) One year after Susan Bro's daughter was killed when a car plowed into counterprotesters at a rally of white nationalist and other right-wing groups in Charlottesville, Virginia, Bro plans to mark the tragedy by going to the street where it happened.Bro's visit this weekend to the place where her daughter, Heather Heyer, 32, died is emblematic of her grit and the purpose she found after the violent episode that shocked Charlottesville and the nation."There's plenty of work to do," Bro said in an interview Friday night on "Anderson Cooper Full Circle" on Facebook. "And, frankly, my new motto for myself is, suck it up, buttercup. Get up, get busy, don't feel sorry for yourself."Nineteen others were injured in the clash during a "Unite the Right" rally on August 12, 2017. An Ohio man accused of driving the car was charged with second-degree murder in Heyer's death. Those who knew the suspect said he held extreme views and a fascination with Nazism.Bro has spent the past year speaking out on social justice issues that were important to her daughter, and launching a foundation in Heyer's name. In an interview later Friday on "Anderson Cooper 360," Bro said she thinks it's time to "take the focus off Heather, as Heather would want us to do. It's been a year now, and let's focus on why she was there. Let's focus on what she died for."Read More
