(CNN) Harsh treatment alleged by immigrant youths held at a Virginia juvenile detention center didn't amount to abuse or neglect under state law, a state investigation ordered by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam concluded on Monday.The allegations, which include that staff verbally and physically abused children, strapped them to restraint chairs for extended periods of time and put bags over their heads, and held them in solitary confinement, are detailed in an October 2017 class-action lawsuit against the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center. The center contracts with the federal government to hold immigrant detainees with severe psychiatric or psychological issues and risk of self-harm.Northam ordered the investigation on June 21, after news organizations, including CNN , reported the allegations drawn from legal declarations made by children held at the facility between 2015 and 2018. One youth, for example, said he was left naked, strapped to a restraint chair, for more than two days.Although Northam's public statement this week said he ordered officials to look into the allegations in the lawsuit, the state's Department of Juvenile Justice and Child Protective Services said they focused on current conditions at Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center."After DJJ's thorough investigation, it did make referrals to local child protective services, but based on their investigation, determined that no further action was necessary," the report said. In closing, it said: "The conclusions of their (DJJ's and CPS's) investigations indicate that there were no life, health, or safety concerns for the residents at SVJC. As of July 3, CPS completed its investigation into the allegations of abuse and found that there was no evidence of abuse or neglect."Read More
