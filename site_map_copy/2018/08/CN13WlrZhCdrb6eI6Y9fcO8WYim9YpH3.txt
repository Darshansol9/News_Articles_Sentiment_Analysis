(CNN) After three devastating months of volcanic activity, the most active lava flow on Hawaii's Big Island has come to a near halt, according to the US Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.Lava flow from a Hawaii volcano has weakened significantly.Fissure 8, the largest and most active on the Kilauea volcano, has gone from a river of destruction to a dwindling stream. For the first time since the massive volcano erupted in May, little to no movement from the lava channel was registered over the weekend, the volcano observatory said.But the coast isn't clear yet. Officials warn that it is common for eruptions to wax and wane, so hazard warnings are still in effect."A return to high levels of lava discharge or new outbreaks in the area of active fissures could occur at any time," the volcano observatory said.
