New York (CNN) The office of Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette responded on Tuesday to Larry Nassar's motion that Judge Rosemarie Aquilina, who presided over his sexual misconduct case in Ingham County Court, be disqualified.Nassar, the disgraced former USA Gymnastics doctor now spending the rest of his life behind bars, has a pending motion challenging his sentence, and has filed a separate motion for the judge who sentenced him to be disqualified from the case.Referring to Nassar as "arguably the most destructive serial sexual predator in the history of the state, perhaps the country," the Michigan AG's office defended Aquilina's conduct during the trial."The magnitude of the sentencing hearing, and the sometimes caustic language the judge employed, was a direct result of Nassar's admitted misdeeds," the filing said. "As the voice of the community, a sentencing judge is permitted to use strong language to redress the victims and express the grievance of society," it continued.Aquilina sentencend Nassar to 40 to 175 years in prison in January, after more than 150 women and girls said in court that he sexually abused them over the past two decades. He is expected to serve that sentence after serving his 60-year sentence in a federal prison on child pornography charges.Read More
