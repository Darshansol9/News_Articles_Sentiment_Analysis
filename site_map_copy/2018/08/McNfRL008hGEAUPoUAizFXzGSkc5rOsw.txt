(CNN) Last fall, a fraternity pledge's parent emailed Louisiana State University's Office of Greek Life and said they'd heard members of another pledge class had been forced to drink alcohol until each member had vomited, according to a federal lawsuit filed against the school."As a parent of a pledge of another fraternity, I am very angry that this has occurred and I know that it will likely continue," the parent wrote. "I do not want to hear that someone's son is dead due to alcohol poisoning, and I expect someone to investigate this incident ASAP and put an end to hazing at LSU."Ten days later, 18-year-old LSU freshman Maxwell Gruver was dead as a result of being forced to drink copious amounts of alcohol in a hazing ritual.This account is from a lawsuit filed by Gruver's parents against LSU, the Phi Delta Theta fraternity -- which Gruver was pledging -- and a number of its members, alleging they failed to adequately address hazing on campus, despite numerous hazing claims.The lawsuit, which seeks $25 million, says the school violated Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, because it handled hazing claims in fraternities and sororities differently.
