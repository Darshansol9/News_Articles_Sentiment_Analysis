(CNN) Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro sent the Pope a letter last month asking him to call on church leaders to "abandon their destructive efforts to silence the survivors" and stick to his plan of holding "clergy and bishops accountable when they abuse or fail to protect the children."A spokesman for the Attorney General's Office said it has not yet received a response from the Pope.The letter comes in the wake of a startling grand jury report released on Tuesday that says internal documents from six Pennsylvania Catholic dioceses show that more than 300 "predator priests" have been credibly accused of sexually abusing more than 1,000 child victims.
