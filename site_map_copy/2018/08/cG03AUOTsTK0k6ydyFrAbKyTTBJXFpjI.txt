Hide Caption 50 of 50Six people have died in this blaze, including three members of the same familyThe Carr Fire has destroyed more than 112,000 acres, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection -- also known as Cal Fire . That's an area larger than Denver. It was 30% contained late Tuesday.Redding police issued some good news Tuesday evening. They said 16 of 20 people missing in Shasta County had been found in less than two hours. Four remain missing.Josh Lister and his family lost their home and belongings after the fire swept through Redding, a city of almost 100,000 people."It was a firestorm when we left," Lister said.Afterward, he was stunned to see the devastation in his neighborhood."It looked like an atomic bomb went off," he said.The Carr Fire is so large and intense that it created its own localized weather system , making it difficult to predict which way the blaze will spread.More than 3,300 fire personnel are battling the flames in triple-digit heat as shifting winds, dry fuel and steep terrain all work against them.The flames were sparked July 23 by the mechanical failure of a vehicle, Cal Fire said. Since then, it has destroyed more than 880 homes.Ferguson Fire kills 2 peopleAn abundance of trees killed by drought and bark beetles has helped the Ferguson Fire spread quickly.After 19 days of destruction, the Ferguson Fire in central California was only 33% contained Tuesday evening.A huge problem facing firefighters is that the flames are largely burning in steep, inaccessible terrain.Unlike the Carr Fire, authorities don't know what started Ferguson, which has now engulfed more than 58,000 acres.Wildfires 'we have historically never seen' beforeIn the past several days, smoke from the California wildfires has stretched all the way to OklahomaAnd California has already spent a quarter of its firefighting budget for the year in the month of July.Cal Fire spokesman Jonathan Cox said the intensity of this summer's wildfires is historic."What we're seeing in California right now is more destructive, larger fires burning at rates that we have historically never seen," he said.
