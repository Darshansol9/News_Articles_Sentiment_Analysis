(CNN) Hawaii Gov. David Ige urged residents Wednesday to prepare weeks' worth of supplies ahead of Hurricane Lane, a Category 4 cyclone that could make landfall in the islands in the coming days.He said government offices would be closed Thursday and Friday as the storm, packing heavy rains, approaches the state."Just want to remind everyone to prepare to shelter in place 14 days of food and supplies and water," he said at a news conference.The storm's dangerous center could make landfall as it moves past the islands from Thursday through Saturday. But even if the eye doesn't cross land, it should draw close enough to the islands that it brings destructive winds and rain accumulations over 20 inches in some locations, forecasters said.Forecasters said the storm was moving to the west-northwest but was expected to make a harder turn toward the northwest and north-northwest over the next 24 hours.
