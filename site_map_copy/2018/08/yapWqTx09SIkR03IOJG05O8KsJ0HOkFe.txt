(CNN) A mystery woman who was caught on camera in the middle of the night repeatedly ringing a doorbell has been identified, officials in Montgomery County, Texas, said.The department said it is not naming the woman because she is a victim of domestic violence and sexual assault."We are confident, based on the totality of the circumstances, and the evidence available to us, that we have identified the female in the doorbell video and that she is safe," Lt. Scott Spencer said in a news conference on Thursday. "She's very distraught about this, she's embarrassed, she's upset, she's in shock that this has come to this."CNN affiliate KPRC reported that a barefoot woman apparently visited at least five houses in the Sunrise Ranch neighborhood in the early morning of August 24. The incident alarmed residents, leading law enforcement to investigate what they called a "suspicious incident."Police released surveillance footage of the woman approaching a home. The grainy video, captured around 3:20 a.m. on August 24, shows a woman walking up to a house and ringing the doorbell. She's wearing a T-shirt, and appears to have some sort of shackle hanging from her right wrist.Read More
