(CNN) The Catholic diocese in San Jose, California, on Thursday released the names of 15 former priests who were credibly accused of sexual abuse with children.Of the 15 priests, 10 have died and the others have been banned from the ministry."I express my deepest apologies for the actions of those who were in positions of authority and who violated that sacred trust by abusing children," Bishop Patrick McGrath said.
