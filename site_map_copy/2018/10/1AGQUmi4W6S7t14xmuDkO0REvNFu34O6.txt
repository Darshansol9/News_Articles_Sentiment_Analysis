(CNN) A California utility company has acknowledged that its equipment was responsible for starting the second largest wildfire in the state's modern history.The incident took place at one of two different sites where the company says the Thomas Fire started.The second starting point was the Anlauf Canyon area of Ventura County but it's unclear if any of the company's equipment was directly involved, SCE said in a statement.The company did not discuss the exact timing of any of those incidents.The Thomas Fire started December 4, 2017 and burned through 281,893 acres in parts of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.It killed two people, including 32-year-old Cory Iverson, an engineer with Cal Fire who was battling the blaze.The fire consumed more than 1,000 structures throughout Southern California before it was completely contained on January 12.In the statement, SCE said it has not inspected its equipment because the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection -- also known as Cal Fire -- removed it because of the agency's investigation.JUST WATCHED Thomas Fire scorches southern California Replay More Videos ...

The allegations include "negligence, inverse condemnation, trespass, private nuisance, and violations of the public utilities and health and safety codes."The Thomas Fire is considered the second largest wildfire in California's modern history. Its size was the equivalent of more than Dallas and Miami combined. The Mendocino complex fire became the largest wildfire in the state in July after burning 458,123 acres.Cal Fire began compiling its list of the largest wildfires in 1932.
