(CNN) The attorney general of Virginia said Wednesday that he is investigating clergy sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, adding to a rapidly growing list of state investigations.Attorney General Mark R. Herring said his probe was motivated by the Pennsylvania grand jury report, issued in August, that found more than 300 "predator priests" had abused more than 1,000 children in that state since 1947."Like so many Americans, I read the grand jury report on clergy abuse in the Catholic dioceses in Pennsylvania, and I felt sick. It made me sick to see the extent of the damage done, the efforts to cover it up, and the complicity and enabling that went on by powerful people who should have known better and should have done more to protect vulnerable children," said Herring."We shouldn't assume the behavior and the problems are limited just to Pennsylvania or to one diocese. If there has been abuse or cover-up in Virginia like there was in Pennsylvania I want to know about it, I want to root it out, and I want to help survivors get justice and get on a path to healing."Herring's announcement comes just one day after Washington, D.C., Attorney General Karl Racine announced that he has launched a civil investigation into whether the Archdiocese of Washington violated the law by covering up the sexual abuse of minors.Read More
