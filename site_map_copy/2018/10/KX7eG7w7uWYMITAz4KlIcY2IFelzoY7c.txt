(CNN) The police officer who fatally shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland four years ago was recently hired by a police department in eastern Ohio, CNN affiliate WTOV-TV reported, citing the department's police chief.Timothy Loehmann is one of six new officers hired in the Village of Bellaire, about 65 miles southwest of Pittsburgh. The town on the Ohio River has a population of about 4,170.Bellaire Police Chief Richard "Dick" Flanagan told WTOV that Loehmann applied to several police departments and still wanted to be a police officer."He's not quitting on being a police officer. He made a decision (in 2014) that's going to stay with him the rest of his life," Flanagan said. "Like anybody else, if you make a mistake, someone's got to give you a second chance, give someone opportunity. There is no worry, I stand behind this officer ... I'll stand behind this officer like I will any of my officers."CNN's efforts to reach Flanagan during the weekend were not successful.Read More
