(CNN) A special prosecutor tasked with investigating sexual misconduct allegations against Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill said Tuesday that the women who accused Hill of inappropriate touching were credible -- but no charges will be filed against him.Attorney Dan Sigler said his role was to investigate whether a crime had been committed, and not to investigate whether Hill's conduct was appropriate. A charge of battery requires proof that Hill's intent in the touching was "rude, insolent or angry," and Sigler wrote in the report he could not prove that beyond a reasonable doubt."There's two different paths or two different rails in this case that are tied together in the same fashion. The one is that somebody committed a crime ... the other rail is that a state official acted inappropriately and in a manner that he should not have," Sigler said."That's not my rail, that's not what I investigated. What I investigated was, did a crime occur there and could it be proven, and I decided there was no crime there that could be proven."Hill still could face a civil lawsuit in the matter.Read More
