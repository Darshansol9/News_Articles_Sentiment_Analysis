"He proceeded to tell me that he wanted to pursue the legal end of what's going on there in Cleveland and he just doesn't have the time to travel back and forth."Flanagan said Loehmann was never sworn in and was still in the training process."Everyone assumes he was automatically hired -- no, there is a process," he said.
