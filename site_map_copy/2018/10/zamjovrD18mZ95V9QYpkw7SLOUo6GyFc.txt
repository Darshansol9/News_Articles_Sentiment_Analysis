He looked straight ahead and didn’t appear to look into the courtroom gallery.After his handcuffs were removed, Bowers took a few minutes to read and sign documents.When asked by Judge Robert C. Mitchell if he was the defendant, Bowers said, “Yes, I am.”A public defender representing Bowers waived a reading of the criminal complaints against him, and waived any issues concerning bail.Bowers will remain in custody without bail until his preliminary hearing, which is scheduled at 10 a.m. ET Thursday.Watch:
