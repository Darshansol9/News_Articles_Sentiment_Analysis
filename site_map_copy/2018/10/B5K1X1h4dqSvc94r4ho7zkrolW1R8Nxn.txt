(CNN) A mild winter could be in store for much of the United States, according to the seasonal forecast released Thursday by NOAA.States from the Pacific Northwest through the Northern Plains and into the Northeast are likely to see above-average temperatures, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center reported.No parts of the country are due to see a colder-than-normal winter.Meantime, drier-than-average conditions are expected for the Great Lakes and portions of the Northern Rockies and the Northern Plains.Those factors could mean less snow from the Mountain West to the Midwest, where lake-effect-snow season is right around the corner.
