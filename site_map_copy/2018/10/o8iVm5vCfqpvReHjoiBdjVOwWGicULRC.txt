(CNN) Harvard University placed its head diving coach on leave late Tuesday after allegations of sexual misconduct against him were detailed in a federal lawsuit filed by athletes he'd coached a few years earlier.Though not named as a defendant, Chris Heaton, 31, is described in the class-action suit filed Sunday as having solicited nude pictures from female athletes at an Indiana diving academy and having sent pictures of his penis to young female athletes there, court documents show.The athletes complained about the conduct beginning in 2015 to Heaton's superiors at the Indiana Diving Academy, known as Ripfest, the suit claims.Heaton did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment. USA Diving's website shows he is a member of the organization."Harvard Athletics was unaware of any allegations of misconduct when Mr. Heaton was hired as the Head Coach for Diving in August 2018," university spokeswoman Rachael Dane told CNN in a statement.
