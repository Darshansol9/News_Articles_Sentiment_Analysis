(CNN) A Texas-sized ice shelf seems to be dabbling in the art of music.The Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica is emitting tones reminiscent of a didgeridoo, or the drone of a horror film soundtrack. The sounds are created when wind whips across the snow dunes, causing the ice to vibrate.Besides being eerie, the discovery of the sounds reveals new insights for the study of glaciers, Colorado State University professor of geophysics Rick Aster said.When humans burn fossil fuels, heat-trapping gases are released into the atmosphere that contribute to the warming of the oceans and the melting of ice. Sea levels are rising because of this warming trend -- both as land-based ice melts and as ocean molecules expand.Researcher Rick Aster installs a broadband seismometer in Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf.An ice shelf is like a cork in a bottle, Aster told CNN. "If the ice shelves come apart, then the restraining force is reduced, and the ice can flow faster from the interior of Antarctica into the ocean and increase the rate of contribution to sea level rises."Read More
