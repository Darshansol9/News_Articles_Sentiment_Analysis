(CNN) Florida's attorney general launched a tip website on Thursday for people to report allegations of past child sex abuse by Catholic priests in the state, adding to a trend of states investigating potential wrongdoing.The tip site is part of Attorney General Pam Bondi's ongoing criminal investigation into the seven Catholic dioceses in the state, according to a news release from her office. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is assisting with the statewide investigation."Any priest that would exploit a position of power and trust to abuse a child is a disgrace to the church and a threat to society," Bondi said in a statement. "I am calling on victims and anyone with information about potential abuse to please report it to my office.
