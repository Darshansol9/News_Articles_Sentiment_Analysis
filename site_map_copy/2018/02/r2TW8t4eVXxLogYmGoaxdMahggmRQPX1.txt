(CNN) When Bruce McArthur was charged with five counts of murder for allegedly killing several gay men and burying their remains in potted plants around Toronto, many in the city's LGBTQ community were in shock.Members of the community recognized him. Paul Ciantar, 54, said he has seen McArthur around the Gay Village at coffee shops or at bars. He did not personally know McArthur, but he knew people who did."They all said that they never would have suspected him," Ciantar told CNN. "He looks like Santa Claus. He looks harmless. That probably really helped him."So far, all of the victims are male, and McArthur had relationships with each of them, some of which were sexual, Toronto Police Service spokeswoman Meaghan Gray said. Police said that two of the victims, Selim Esen and Andrew Kinsman, were active on dating apps."He was in the community.
