FBI memoThat GOP memo alleging misconduct by the FBI in the Russia investigation will probably come out very soon -- possibly today. President Trump indicates he won't stop its release . Two sources told CNN that Trump is telling his friends he thinks the memo helps undermine the Russia probe. Critics say the memo is a mischaracterization of the facts and weaponizes intelligence for a political fight. There's fear in the White House that FBI Director Christopher Wray will quit if the memo is released. His predecessor, James Comey, tweeted amid the controversy that "weasels and liars never hold the field." CNN's Stephen Collinson ponders five big questions about the memo.2. Cape Town waterCape Town issued new water restrictions as the South African city inches closer to "Day Zero." Residents aren't supposed to use more than 13 gallons of water per day (a typical bathtub holds about 80 gallons). City officials fear the city will run out of water on April 16, which they're calling Day Zero. Drought, climate change and population growth are blamed for the crisis. Making matters worse: Only about 55% of residents are curbing their water use to daily limits.3. Larry NassarOne of Larry Nassar's attorneys said she doesn't believe he could have assaulted so many people -- or that all the women who've confronted him in court were actually harmed . "There were girls who had perfectly normal lives that never questioned the medical treatment done by Larry Nassar," lawyer Shannon Smith told a Detroit radio station. The blowback to her comments was intense . Doctors and physical therapists blasted her, saying she was misrepresenting what they do and could possibly deter people from getting treatment. Even Nassar tried to distance himself from her comments.Meantime, the town manager of Meridian Township, Michigan, apologized on behalf of his community to Brianne Randall-Gay, one of Larry Nassar's victims. "We failed. ... We let you down," Frank Walsh said. "We felt this needed to be done in public because what happened to you was in public." Randall-Gay complained to police there about Nassar in 2004, but the complaint went nowhere.JUST WATCHED Town gives emotional apology to Nassar victim Replay More Videos ...

It's not clear what sparked the violence. Calais was once home to a so-called "jungle" camp that held hundreds of migrants hoping to make it to the UK. The camp was torn down in October 2016, but about 500 migrants remain in the city. France and Britain signed a treaty last month aimed at speeding migrants' UK asylum applications.JUST WATCHED Thousands of migrants camping at Paris metro station Replay More Videos ...
