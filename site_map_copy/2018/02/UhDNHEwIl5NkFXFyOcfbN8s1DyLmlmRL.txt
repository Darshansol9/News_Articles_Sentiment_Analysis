His spokeswoman, Katie Betta, later explained that the senator was presiding over the Senate when the five boys came by. Negron also met separately with a larger group of students earlier Wednesday, she said.The students who sought a separate meeting in his office were holding signs saying, "Arms are for hugging," "Parkland Strong" and "No NRA Money."From left, Samuel Muster, 15, Zach Lesk, 16, and Zach Randoph, 15, show off the signs they took to lawmakers' offices.The group of teenagers said they have been visiting offices at the Capitol hoping to speak with political leaders and representatives. But they've been turned away by about six legislators, including the aide to Negron, and were becoming frustrated by the many closed doors."We've been heard by other people, but the people here who make the laws aren't really listening," said Agu Felman, 16, a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas in Parkland, Florida, where a gunman killed 17 people in a mass shooting February 14.
