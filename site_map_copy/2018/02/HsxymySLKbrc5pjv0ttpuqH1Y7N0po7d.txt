(CNN) Amanda Meyer grew up around guns. She took a hunter safety class in her hometown in Iowa when she was 14 and her parents emphasized proper gun handling from a very early age.Now, as an adult living in New Haven, Connecticut, she has decided to saw into two pieces her 40-caliber Sig Sauer P229 handgun in the wake of the latest school shooting in Florida.In a video posted on Facebook, Meyer says she doesn't want her weapon to end up in the wrong hands."If I sell this gun, it may get to the hands of a normal person, a mass murderer or a suicide victim," she says in the video. "And there's no way that I can know where it ends up, especially if it changes hands a few times. The only way I can know for sure that this gun doesn't hurt anyone is that it doesn't exist."Meyer is one of several gun owners who have posted videos or pictures of themselves destroying their weapons or handing them over to police following the massacre last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead . Some have used the hashtags #oneless or #onelessgun to illustrate their endeavors.Read More
