But she couldn't.Why? Because, according to her, she has cancer.That's what she said in a video posted to Facebook that shows her group packing up from their Alaska Airlines plane as it sat at the gate in Hawaii."You're taking me off the airplane because I don't have a doctor's note saying I can fly," a woman is heard saying. "All these people are waiting, and I'm being removed as if I'm a criminal or contagious, because I have cancer and no note to fly."Sedway did eventually get on a flight back to San Jose, California, although she didn't get home until late Tuesday night.
