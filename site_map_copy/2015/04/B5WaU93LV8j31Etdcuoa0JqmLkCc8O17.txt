: Now that the guilty verdicts are in, the jury turns its attention to whether Dzhokhar Tsarnaev should be put to death or spend the rest of his life in prison for bombing the Boston Marathon almost two years ago. Tsarnaev was found guilty on all 30 counts yesterday ; 17 of which could send him to death row. The trial will resume, possibly as early as next week, and the penalty phase will begin. Jurors will hear evidence of what makes Tsarnaev's crimes so heinous he should be executed. The defense will try to soften his actions by painting him in a more sympathetic light.
