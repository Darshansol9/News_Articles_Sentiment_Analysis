Story highlights Scientist: Fossils once renamed should again be classified as BrontosaurusStudy took five years and involved visits to 20 museums worldwide(CNN) Everybody loves a good comeback story -- especially one that's dino-sized.After its name was booted from science books for more than a century, a new study suggests that the Brontosaurus belongs to its own genera, and therefore deserves its own name.O.C. Marsh first named the Brontosaurus in 1879, after he received 25 crates of bones discovered at Como Bluff, Wyoming, according to the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History . Similar to, though not as large as the Apatosaurus discovered a couple of years prior, Marsh named the dinosaur, "Brontosaurus," or "thunder lizard."Apatosaurus had three sacral vertebrae in its hip region and Brontosaurus had five, according to the museum's website, so Marsh gave the dinosaurs two different names. Later it was discovered that the number of sacral vertebrae is related to age: as the animal gets older, two of the vertebrae fuse to the sacrum.Paleontologist Elmer Riggs concluded in 1903 that the Brontosaurus was really a young Apatosaurus, and therefore must go by that name, according to the museum.Read More
