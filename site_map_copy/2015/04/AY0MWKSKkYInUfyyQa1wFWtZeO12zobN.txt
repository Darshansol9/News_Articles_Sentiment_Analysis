(CNN) Launching rockets is a complicated thing. Landing them upright on a platform floating in the ocean? Well, that's never been done before. SpaceX, the private space exploration company founded by billionaire Elon Musk , hopes to give it a try. But weather forced it to scrub Monday's plan to launch.SpaceX said on Twitter that Tuesday at 4:10 p.m. ET will be the next opportunity for the company to launch a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon on a flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to the International Space Station.That will be the easy part.After the launch, SpaceX will try to guide the bottom stage of the rocket upright onto a platform, or what it calls an autonomous spaceport drone ship , in the Atlantic Ocean off Florida.Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth's atmosphere or, like NASA's space shuttle boosters , they fall back into the ocean. So why try to land one?JUST WATCHED See SpaceX rocket crash landing Replay More Videos ...

SpaceX says it will keep trying and, after it masters landing at sea, hopes to someday land rockets on the ground.What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon? The smaller, top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth's atmosphere.The SpaceX Dragon spacecraft carries supplies to the International Space Station.The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon. They'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments, trash and other stuff to send back to Earth. When they're done, Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California.
