Boston (CNN) We don't have to pretend anymore: Dzhokhar "Jahar" Tsarnaev did it. The jury has spoken. He was in cahoots with his big brother, and together they set off the deadly bombs at the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon.Jahar survived and his brother didn't, so he's the one we're left to deal with.The way the law sees it, Jahar blew people up on a nice April day, killing two women in their 20s and a little boy. Jahar scarred and maimed more than 250 others and changed countless lives forever.And, even if his brother pulled the trigger, Jahar shot a 26-year-old campus police officer between the eyes a few days later because he wanted the cop's gun.No cameras are allowed at the Tsarnaev trial. But CNN's Ann O'Neill will be there every day. Think of her as The 13th Juror , bringing insights here weekly. And follow @AnnoCNN on Twitter daily.In the end, even Tsarnaev's own lawyer had grown impatient with the pretense of innocence: "The horrific acts that we've heard about -- the death, destruction and devastation that we've heard about -- deserve to be condemned, and the time is now," Judy Clarke said in her closing argument earlier this month.She urged jurors to "find the truth" and hold her 21-year-old client accountable.But how? What we do next will say more about us as a society than it ever could about Tsarnaev.He wrote in his pleasure boat hideout that innocents must pay with their lives for what our government is doing to his fellow Muslims. He's no innocent, but how will the jurors make him pay? Will they demand retribution as well?We have seen what the bombs did to the bodies of the three marathon spectators who died. They tore them apart.Now we must steel ourselves for another horror -- what the bombs did to the hearts of minds of the people left behind. Many of them have been torn apart as well.The parents of 8-year-old Martin Richard say enough is enough. They have asked prosecutors to take the death penalty off the table for Tsarnaev so they don't have to relive the worst day of their lives, over and over, for years to come. They want no more appeals. They simply want what their little boy wanted. Peace.Two other bomb survivors who lost legs added their voices to the chorus of opposition. Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes don't want Tsarnaev to be executed even though he caused them "severe pain and suffering" and forever changed their lives."If there is anyone who deserves the ultimate punishment, it is the defendant," Kensky and Downes said in a statement published in The Boston Globe on the eve of the marathon. "However, we must overcome the impulse for vengeance. Our opposition to the death penalty is both intensely emotional and profoundly practical."But other survivors and victims' families do favor the death penalty, said U.S Attorney Carmen Ortiz. Their wishes also have to be considered.And so, prosecutors this week will set about proving that Tsarnaev is the worst of the worst kind of criminal. They will show how he brought about suffering and changed people's lives for the worst. They will show what he took from the victims' families.The defense will try to soften the jury's view of Tsarnaev, portraying him as the bitter product of an immigrant family's failed American dream and the puppet of a dominant older brother.There's now excusing what Tsarnaev did, as his lawyer is the first to acknowledge. But if we demand his life as retribution, are we really that much better than him?Joe Kebartas has been a fixture outside the courthouse every day of the Tsarnaev trial.Joe Kebartas, a 66-year-old retiree from South Boston, hopes so. A Vietnam veteran and former mental health worker, Kebartas stood in front of the John Joseph Moakley U.S. Courthouse every morning of Tsarnaev's trial. He held a simple sign, written by hand on poster board: "Death Penalty is Murder."The word "Murder" was lettered in red, the color of blood.Along with the construction crews, bomb-sniffing dogs and line of television cameras, Kebartas became part of the daily scene on the courthouse sidewalk. He was there when the snow was up past his knees. He was there in the rain and sleet. On most days, he stood alone.But now that the case is entering the penalty phase, Kebartas said he expects he'll see some company -- like the man in the mariachi hat who joined him the other day. Some of them will come from an interfaith group called Pax Christi. Kebartas, a devout Catholic, is a member of the group and shares its strong opposition to the death penalty.Judy Clarke and other defense attorneys walk past Kerbartas as they arrive at federal court Wednesday.Tsarnaev's attorneys exchanged nods and smiles with Kebartas as they strode into court on Wednesday. The defense lawyers, Clarke and David Bruck, greet him like a kindred spirit. It's a daily routine for the nationally prominent death penalty opponents.Their opposition to the death penalty is why Clarke and Bruck take on clients like Jahar Tsarnaev. But a few hours after they waved at Kebartas, they learned for certain what they had suspected all along: They had their work cut out for them.The jury found Tsarnaev guilty of all 30 counts against him, including 17 that offer just two options for punishment: life in prison or the death penalty.The second part of this trial, called the penalty phase, begins today, April 21 -- the day after this year's Boston Marathon.Photos: Judy Clarke and her clients Photos: Judy Clarke and her clients Judy Clarke has defended some of the most notorious criminals in recent American history and has managed to keep several off death row.

He was arrested on April 19, 2013, after a massive manhunt following an overnight shootout with police that left his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- the other man wanted in the bombings -- dead. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found guilty of all 30 counts that he faced in the Boston bombing trial on April 8, 2015. Seventeen of those counts were capital charges , meaning he is eligible for the death penalty. Hide Caption 2 of 8 Photos: Judy Clarke and her clients Jared Lee Loughner pleaded guilty to the January 2011 attempted assassination of then-U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. The Arizona shooting killed six people and wounded 13 others, including Giffords. He was diagnosed by two mental health experts as paranoid schizophrenic, and he was sentenced to life in prison under a plea bargain. Hide Caption 3 of 8 Photos: Judy Clarke and her clients Eric Robert Rudolph was defended by Clarke after he pleaded guilty in 2005 to bombing a women's clinic in Birmingham, Alabama, and other bombings, including at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. Prosecutors dropped the death penalty after he led them to dynamite caches in North Carolina. Hide Caption 4 of 8 Photos: Judy Clarke and her clients Zacarias Moussaoui, also known as the 20th hijacker in the 9/11 attacks, was defended by Clarke only briefly since he repeatedly fired his lawyers. He abruptly pleaded guilty to terror conspiracy charges in July 2002, though he was not given the death penalty. Hide Caption 5 of 8 Photos: Judy Clarke and her clients Buford O. Furrow was sentenced to five life terms for a shooting spree at a Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles and the fatal shooting of a Filipino-American postal worker in 1999. Prosecutors dropped the death penalty when the defense documented and charted Furrow's long history of psychiatric treatment for bipolar disorder. Hide Caption 6 of 8 Photos: Judy Clarke and her clients Clarke kept Ted Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber, off death row. He pleaded guilty in January 1998 to making and transporting bomb materials that killed three people. Federal prosecutors backed away from the death penalty after their own expert diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic. Hide Caption 7 of 8 Photos: Judy Clarke and her clients Susan Smith was convicted of murdering her two sons by strapping them into a car and rolling the car into a lake in 1994. Clarke portrayed Smith as a woman so tormented by her failures in life that she even failed at her own suicide and jumped out of the car. Smith did not receive the death penalty. Hide Caption 8 of 8Clarke has been able to save some of America's most notorious criminals from the death chamber: Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, who recently told Vanity Fair's Mark Bowden she was a "sicko;" Aryan Nation member Buford Furrow, who threatened her life; Zacarias Moussaoui, who shouted "death to America" and vowed to kill everyone at his trial; Olympic bomber Eric Rudolph; and Jared Loughner, who shot U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in the head as he killed six people at an Arizona shopping center.As sportswriters are fond of saying, "All winning streaks must come to an end," and this may be the case that ends Clarke's. Tsarnaev may be her first death row client.At times Kebartas is joined by other protesters, including the man in the sombrero.Massachusetts is not the sort of place where one would expect that to happen. The state banned capital punishment a generation ago, but Tsarnaev has been convicted under federal law. Massachusetts opinion polls have been pretty consistent: About two-thirds of the people surveyed oppose capital punishment and think Tsarnaev should instead spend the rest of his days behind bars.He survived a shootout with police in Watertown in which he and his brother were outgunned 210 rounds to 56. He survived another fusillade of bullets into the boat where he was hiding.As one unsuccessful jury prospect put it: "How many thousands of rounds did you fire into that boat, and you couldn't kill him? I'm not going to kill him for you now."JUST WATCHED Life or death for Boston bomber? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Life or death for Boston bomber? 02:08Some of the people chosen for Tsarnaev's jury said they had reservations about the death penalty. It's not something that's talked about much here, because it usually isn't an issue in Massachusetts.But each person on the jury is there because he or she agreed to override personal opinions and follow the law.The next step will strip a lot of personal opinion out of the process. Jurors instead will be asked to weigh what they hear from others. They will probably hear victim impact statements from bombing survivors and families of the three people killed. They are also likely to hear a little about Tsarnaev's family background and school history.The parties' witness lists have not been made public, and a behind-the-scenes battle appears to be brewing over a social worker the defense hopes to call. They want her to narrate the Tsarnaev family's story of political and religious strife in Russia, their immigration to America, their struggle to assimilate, and, ultimately, the parents' divorce and return to their homeland when their dream of a better life failed.JUST WATCHED Boston bombing survivor: No closure, but will 'move on' Replay More Videos ...

Instead, he doodles. He doesn't appear to pray. Instead, he scratches at his head, runs his fingers through his tangled curls and pulls at his beard.It leaves one wondering whether he's capable of speaking eloquently on his own behalf. Although many have speculated over whether he will testify, I wonder if he even can.His boat hideout was pocked with bullets and streaked with his blood. His head and hands were bloody when he emerged from the boat. But so far, there has been no discussion of his injuries at the trial.But earlier in the case, Dr. Stephen Odom, who treated him before his bedside arraignment at Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said Tsarnaev had multiple gunshot wounds, including one that injured his mouth and lower face. It was a "high-powered injury" that fractured the base of his skull, shattered a bone in his neck, and injured his mouth and pharynx.It is possible he suffered a concussion or other brain injury, Odom said in a transcript that had been under seal.JUST WATCHED Survivor: I won't lose sleep over him being put to death Replay More Videos ...

His left eyebrow seems permanently raised, as if by paralysis or nerve damage.He enters and leaves the courtroom stiffly, with a slight limp. But it's still possible to detect traces of the college boy strut he displayed while picking out a half gallon of milk at a Whole Foods Market about 20 minutes after the bombs went off."It's a horrible crime, there's no doubt about that," said Kebartas, standing outside the courthouse with his anti-death penalty sign."According to what was written in the boat, he was committing this crime because of what the U.S. was doing to the Muslims in the Mideast, and retribution," he said.Punishing Tsarnaev with the death penalty "doesn't solve anything," he added. "For a criminal to commit to a crime, a murder, and then for the state to lower itself to murder the murderer -- that's a crime itself. Every life is important and the state has no justification for taking anyone's life."Protestor Jose Briceno holds signs outside court denouncing Tsarnaev, his face covered by a U.S. flag.Later on Wednesday, Kebartas got some company outside the courthouse, but it wasn't someone who shared his point of view.This man, covering his face with an American flag bandana, carried a lime green sign with several misspellings and an f-word. The message stridently denounced Tsarnaev as "just another Islamic terrorist" while at the same time insisting, "This is NOT Islamophobia."Maybe not. But it does look an awful lot like a concept Babylonian King Hammurabi put forth in his code of law around 1750 B.C.: Lex Talionis, they called it in Latin. We know it as "an eye for an eye."
