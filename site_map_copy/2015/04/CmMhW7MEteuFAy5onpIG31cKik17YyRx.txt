(CNN) A California county has decided to settle with a man who was beaten after trying to evade police on a horse. The violent arrest will cost the county over half a million dollars.Earlier this month, deputies in San Bernardino County tried to serve a warrant on Francis Pusok related to an identity theft investigation. But Pusok fled the police, first leading them on a car chase. He ditched the car and fled on foot.

McMahon called the incident disturbing and promised an internal investigation.Read More
