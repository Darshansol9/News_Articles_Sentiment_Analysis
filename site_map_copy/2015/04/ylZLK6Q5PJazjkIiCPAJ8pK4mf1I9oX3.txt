And not this year -- at least not if you're a member of the jury that convicted Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the bombings.That's what federal Judge George A. O'Toole told jurors Tuesday, stressing the importance of avoiding anything that could be prejudicial in the trial's sentencing phase. That begins April 21, a day after this year's edition of the landmark race."Do not attend the Boston Marathon or any events or gatherings related to the anniversary or the current running of the Boston Marathon," O'Toole said in court.The judge spoke for less than 10 minutes, and stressed the seriousness of his warnings.
