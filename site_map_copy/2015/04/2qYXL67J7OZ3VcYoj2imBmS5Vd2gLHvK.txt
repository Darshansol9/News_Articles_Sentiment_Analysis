Story highlights The whale, Varvara, swam a round trip from Russia to Mexico, nearly 14,000 milesThe previous record was set by a humpback whale that migrated more than 10,000 miles(CNN) A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded.The whale, named Varvara, swam nearly 14,000 miles (22,500 kilometers), according to a release from Oregon State University, whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study. Varvara, which is Russian for "Barbara," left her primary feeding ground off Russia's Sakhalin Island to cross the Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico.Varvara's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website. It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the "warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions."JUST WATCHED Rare sperm whale encounter Replay More Videos ...
