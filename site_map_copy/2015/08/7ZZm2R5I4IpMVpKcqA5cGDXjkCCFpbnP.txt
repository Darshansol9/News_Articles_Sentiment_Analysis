"We don't have any indications of an intruder or any indication that the gunshot was self-inflicted."The man, who Rector identified as 31-year-old Divine Vaniah Chambliss, and the boy "were possibly the only two individuals who were present when the incident occurred," a police press release said.In an email Wednesday to CNN, Rector said: "This is not going to be a suicide and so far there is no evidence of an intruder or any other third person involved. I can't, with certainty, rule out other possibilities at this time, but this is looking more and more like a horrible, accidental shooting by a child who found a handgun in the home."Read More
