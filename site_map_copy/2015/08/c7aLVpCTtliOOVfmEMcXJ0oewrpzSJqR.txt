Vicki Chen, a 24-year-old investigative producer with KVUE in Austin, Texas, called on her colleagues to use the hashtag #WeStandWithWDBJ"My photographer and I drove an hour outside of Austin for our story today, and at one point, stopped on the side of the road to shoot some video," Chen said later."In that moment, in broad daylight, in a safe neighborhood, I suddenly felt a pang of fear. Are we in danger? Is this safe? But just as quickly as the feeling came, others replaced it. Indignation, maybe? Pride? I thought, I can stand here and be scared, or I can stand here and be a journalist, which is what Alison Parker and Adam Ward did."
