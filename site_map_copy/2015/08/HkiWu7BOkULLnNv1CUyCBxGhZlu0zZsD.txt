Story highlights U.S. Geological Survey research indicates 143 million Americans live in earthquake-prone areasA study looked at ground shaking, which is caused by the passage of seismic wavesCalifornia still tops the list of states most at risk of an earthquake(CNN) You don't have to live in California to be at risk of experiencing an earthquake, according to a new study. Research released by the U.S. Geological Survey indicates nearly half of Americans live in earthquake-prone areas."The new exposure estimate is nearly double the previous 2006 estimate, based on population growth and advances in science," said William Leith, A senior science adviser for earthquakes at the USGS.More than 143 million Americans could be exposed to potentially damaging ground shaking caused by earthquakes , the study concludes. Researchers looked at how populations have grown in earthquake-prone areas, and they say improvements in data collection provide a more accurate estimate than in years past.The study looked at ground shaking, which is caused by the passage of seismic waves. This shaking causes most property damage during an earthquake and can range from weak and barely noticeable to violent or extreme, with catastrophic damage.As you might expect, California tops the list of states most at risk , but others may surprise you. Based on this new assessment, states in the eastern United States have a greater chance of having a damaging quake than was previously thought. A lot was learned from the magnitude-5.8 earthquake that hit Virginia in 2011 researchers say ; the quake caused considerable damage and forced the Washington Monument to close for repairs, which were just completed in May 2014.Read More
