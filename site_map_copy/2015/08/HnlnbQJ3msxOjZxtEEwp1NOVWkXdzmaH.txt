It's Wednesday, and here are five things to know for your new day.DONALD TRUMP: The Donald is (surprise) burning up all the political oxygen in the room for the umpteenth day in a row. On Monday he reignited his feud with Fox News' Megyn Kelly -- hurling more insults at her and retweeting a tweet that called her a "bimbo." Then last night, during a news conference in Iowa , he demanded that she apologize to him (yeah, you read that right) for the questions she asked him during the first GOP debate. But he wasn't finished. During this same news conference he got into a testy exchange with Univision anchor Jorge Ramos over Trump's immigration plan. At one point Ramos was escorted out of the room, but he later returned and he and Trump continued to exchange pleasantries.
