(CNN) The man suspected of killing a Louisiana trooper in Lake Charles is believed to have killed his own roommate after an altercation that preceded the policeman's slaying, Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Tony Mancuso said Tuesday.The roommate has been identified as Blake Brewer, and the suspected shooter, Kevin Daigle, was driving Brewer's truck when Trooper Steven Vincent was shot, a statement from the sheriff's office said."While being interviewed by state police, Daigle led investigators to believe an altercation occurred between him and Brewer which led to Brewer's death," the statement said.Louisiana State Police Superintendent Col. Michael Edmonson stopped short of calling Daigle's remarks a confession, explaining that investigators need to be careful what information they release so as not to jeopardize the prosecution.Investigators had been looking for Brewer on Monday morning after the Moss Bluff man's employer called police to say that he had not arrived at work or called in sick, which was not customary for Brewer, the sheriff's office said. They were en route to his home when the state police contacted them to relay what Daigle had told them, authorities said.JUST WATCHED Police: Last 24 hours have been an unnerving tragedy Replay More Videos ...

"Once deputies arrived on the scene, they forced entry into the house and found the victim deceased."It's not clear if Daigle was staying with Brewer on a permanent or temporary basis, Mancuso told reporters Monday.Detectives with the sheriff's office were back at the crime scene Tuesday morning, gathering evidence. Daigle is already charged with first-degree murder in Vincent's slaying, and Mancuso told CNN that the investigation is likely to yield more charges against the 54-year-old.Tragic traffic stopVincent, a 44-year-old father and veteran trooper, was shot Sunday during a traffic encounter with Daigle, whose pickup was stuck in a ditch when Vincent arrived, Edmonson said. Vincent died of his injuries the next day."As an organization, we are heartbroken over this senseless and tragic death," Edmonson said. "Our thoughts and prayers are with his surviving wife, Katherine, and his son (9-year-old) Ethan as well as his entire extended family," including two brothers who are also in law enforcement: Terrell Vincent, who's also a trooper, and Keith Vincent, who's chief of police in Iowa, Louisiana.Several people had called to report a pickup had been swerving all over the road. Vincent realized the suspect's vehicle matched the description of the truck whose driver had reportedly been driving recklessly. He spoke to Daigle, who appeared to be impaired and was alone in the truck, Edmonson said.Daigle then opened the truck's door and came out with a sawed-off shotgun that had been painted green, making it difficult to see, police said. Daigle allegedly shot Vincent before speaking to him, according to police."You could hear him breathing, telling him, 'You're lucky. You're going to die soon,'" according to Edmonson, who said he listened to a recording of the interaction.JUST WATCHED Trooper shot, killed after stopping to help someone Replay More Videos ...

"They are heroes."Daigle is now being held at the Calcasieu Parish jail.
