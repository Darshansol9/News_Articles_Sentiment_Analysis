(CNN) If you are Bob Dylan's biggest fan, this just might be the holiday home for you.The famous "big pink" house -- the place where Dylan and The Band recorded the "Basement Tapes" in 1967, honored in the title of The Band's 1968 album "Music from Big Pink" -- is now available as a vacation rental property.The coral-colored house in Saugerties, New York, is listed on the vacation rental site VRBO"Rock and Roll history hidden in tranquil woods," wrote one guest in a review. "Imagining the members of the Band and Bob Dylan driving this road almost 50 years ago gave us chills."Another guest wrote, "The spirit of The Band and Bob Dylan lingers in every room and the music echoes off the walls."Fans, both young and old, appreciate the historical relevance of the house, owner Don LaSala said."Some people kiss the ground," he added.The owners, Don and Susan LaSala, are offering renters the "big pink" including the dormer unit for the first time this summer for a rate of $650 per night.The dormer unit, which has since been updated, was Levon Helm's bunk area in the late '60s, according to the listing.The basement where songs like "Tears of Rage" and "Too Much of Nothing" were recorded is not included in the online listing, but may be available on a case-by-case basis."It's pretty much the way we got it originally," said LaSala of the legendary basement. "It's a basement," he added, rafters and concrete.The 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom house, which sleeps nine, is 4 miles from the village of Woodstock.For the past 18 years, the owners have tried to maintain the house as a "pristine rural sanctuary," without turning it into a hotel, LaSala said.The couple bought the house in 1998, making them the third owners of the house, mainly because they loved the land, but "the best rehearsal and jamming space in the world was for me, of course, a notable bonus," wrote LaSala, who is also a musician.The house has been of interest to fans and various media outlets over the years, but visitors became more frequent with the convenience of online directions to the house, LaSala said.The LaSalas lived in the two-family house for many years, with long-term tenants in the other portion. But it wasn't until recently they decided to list it as a vacation rental property.Sites like Airbnb and VRBO make it easier to manage, LaSala said.Member of The Band Rick Danko, Garth Hudson and Levon Helm have stopped by the "big pink" house over the years, according to LaSala.
