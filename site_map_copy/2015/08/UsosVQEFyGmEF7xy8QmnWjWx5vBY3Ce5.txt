The experiment will advance the use of 3-D printers to make replacement parts and even satellites in space, researchers say."We wanted to be the pioneers of that and get to be the first to tackle the problem," said Virginia Tech computer science senior Sebastian Welsh of Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania.The launch was scheduled for Tuesday morning, but officials at Wallops, near Chincoteague, Virginia, called it off after concluding weather would not clear before the 10 a.m. launch window expired.Read More
