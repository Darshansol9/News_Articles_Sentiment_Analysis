Story highlights Gray's family is "dismayed that someone leaked the autopsy report," lawyer saysAutopsy report shows Gray suffered injury akin to shallow-water diving accident, newspaper saysSix officers and their attorneys haven't seen the autopsy report yet, they say(CNN) A day after six Baltimore police officers pleaded not guilty to all charges in Freddie Gray's death, a newspaper reported his autopsy shows he suffered a "high-energy injury" most likely caused by a sudden slowing of the police van holding him.The State Medical Examiner's Office declared Gray's death a homicide because officers failed to follow safety guidelines "through acts of omission," according to a copy of the report obtained by the newspaper.The report provides a better picture of what happened to Gray, whom police put on his belly in the back of the van. Gray wasn't belted down, and he may have risen to his feet and then was slammed against an interior panel during an abrupt change in direction, according to the newspaper's account of the autopsy report.With his ankles and wrists shackled, Gray was "at risk for an unsupported fall during acceleration or deceleration of the van," according to the newspaper's summary of the report.JUST WATCHED Baltimore officer: Mayor doesn't have our backs Replay More Videos ...
