King became a man at age 9 when his mother died, the Rev. Herron Wilson said at the funeral for the blues legend on Saturday.The words that King's mother said to him on her deathbed -- to be good, and to do good for others -- shaped the path that he followed during a career that lasted nearly 70 years."He still maintained the common touch despite his fame," Wilson told the hundreds of mourners who attended the funeral service in Indianola, Mississippi. "He kept asking, what else can I give to my community."It was King's wish to have his funeral held at the Bell Grove Baptist Church in Indianola, where King spent his teenage years working in cotton fields as a poverty-stricken youth in the Mississippi Delta.King not only strummed his chords into the hearts of millions, but inspired generations of blues and rock musicians.
