Story highlights One officer involved in Ford's shooting was found to have acted outside police department policyThe other officer was found in breach of only one pointThe board of police commissioners' findings are not legally binding(CNN) Two days after a police officer shot Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, two officers in South Los Angeles fired upon another young black man. Ezell Ford died in a hospital from his wounds at age 25; his family had said he was mentally ill.Protests in Ferguson drowned out news of Ezell's death on August 11, 2014. But the movement launched in the St. Louis suburb may have had an influence on getting a measure of justice for him Tuesday.A civilian committee tasked with oversight of the Los Angeles Police Department found in a unanimous vote that one of the officers involved in the shooting acted against police department policy throughout the confrontation with Ezell: from how he approached Ezell, to how he scuffled with him, to how he drew his gun, to the shooting.The committee, known as the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners, found the other officer was also unjustified in how he initially drew his gun. But it ruled that he was within department policy when he fired on Ford when he saw Ford scuffling with his partner.Its decision is not legally binding, amounting more to a recommendation. The district attorney's office, which is conducting its own investigation, will make the final determination whether to file charges.JUST WATCHED Ezell Ford: Another Michael Brown?
