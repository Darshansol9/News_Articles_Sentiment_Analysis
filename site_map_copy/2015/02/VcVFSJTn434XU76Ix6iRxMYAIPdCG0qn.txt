(CNN) NASA has released its proposed 2016 budget request of $18.5 billion, an increase of $500 million over the agency's approved budget this year.Standing in front of three prototype spacecraft at the Kennedy Space Station in Florida, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden on Monday laid out the agency's accomplishments."These are tangible examples of our progress," Bolden said, referring to Boeing's CST-100 mock-up and two test vehicles already flown in space -- Lockheed Martin's Orion and SpaceX Dragon crew capsules.The proposal asks Congress to increase funding for the commercial spaceflight program by 50%, from $800 million to $1.2 billion.
