The boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina Brown, who is fighting for her life at an Atlanta hospital, unleashed against her family Monday on Twitter, defending his actions and accusing her father of wanting her money.Brown is the daughter of R&B singer Bobby Brown and the late star Whitney Houston."Bobby seen his daughter 4 times in the last 5 yrs," Nick Gordon tweeted. "Now him and his family want Whitneys $$$."Gordon has said he's been prevented from visiting Brown in the hospital -- an accusation her father has denied."Let me be very clear, Mr. Gordon was offered an opportunity to potentially visit Bobbi Kristina and he declined to meet the terms of any possible visit," Bobby Brown said in a statement through his lawyers."Obviously Mr. Gordon is not as desperate to visit Bobbi Kristina as he wants the world to believe."The statement did not specify what the terms were.Without specifying the details of those terms, Gordon's lawyers said they advised him against meeting them, "particularly in light of Mr. Brown's inability to guarantee access.""In an effort to do all he can to visit, Nick has repeatedly offered to meet with Mr. Brown privately to discuss his request in person, rather than through lawyers," lawyers Randall M. Kessler and Joe S. Habachy said in a statement. "Those offers have also been rejected. We hope Mr. Brown has a change of heart."Bobby Brown's attorney responded with another statement, saying Gordon has yet to tell Brown in writing what happened to his daughter.I've talked to the cops no lawyer. If Roswell Detectives know how to do there job everything is cool. #don'tfabricate — Nick Gordon (@nickdgordon) February 23, 2015Bobbi Kristina Brown, 21, remains in a medically induced coma at Emory University Hosital more than three weeks after she was found unresponsive in a bathtub.Police have said they're treating her case as a criminal investigation after she was found on January 31 at her home in Roswell, Georgia.The extent of her injuries is not known.CPR for 10-15min responding officer didn't take over until EMS came it's like re living my worst nightmare!!!! — Nick Gordon (@nickdgordon) February 23, 2015Her mother, who died in 2012, was similarly found in a bathtub.
