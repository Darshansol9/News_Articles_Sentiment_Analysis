(CNN) Tuesday's wreck in Southern California is a reminder of the potentially fatal combination of trains and cars.No one died in the accident, which happened before sunrise when the driver of a produce truck allegedly mistook the train tracks for the road and tried to turn onto them. But at least 28 people were injured, including three in critical condition.According to Operation Lifesaver, a group dedicated to education around rail safety, injuries and fatalities at railroad-highway crossings are a serious, but often preventable, problem.
