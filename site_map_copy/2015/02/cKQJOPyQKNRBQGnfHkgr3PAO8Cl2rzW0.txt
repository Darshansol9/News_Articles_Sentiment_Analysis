It's also unclear what he was doing in the moments before.Max Lomas, 24, was the other person there.In response to several media outlets reporting Lomas' lengthy rap sheet, Philip Holloway, an attorney initially representing Lomas, issued a statement saying his client is a cooperative witness and that Lomas' most recent arrest in January on drug- and weapon-related charges has nothing to do with Brown's hospitalization.A different attorney, J.Thom Morgan, was representing Lomas by Wednesday. Morgan told CNN that his client is cooperating with police."We don't believe our client is the subject of a criminal investigation," Morgan told CNN on Wednesday night.So will anyone be held responsible for what happened to Brown?
