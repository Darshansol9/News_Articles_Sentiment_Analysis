Story highlights A Colorado paleontologist found 85% of a dinosaur while working in MontanaHis team and outside experts determined it was a new species from the late Cretaceous(CNN) Back when what is now Montana straddled a sea, "Ava" roamed the land.That's the nickname given to the dinosaur pieced together by a team of Colorado-based paleontologists, who claimed this week that Ava is an example of a brand-new species that has significant similarities with the triceratops but appeared on Earth about 9 million years earlier.This species hasn't got a formal scientific name yet, though Mike Triebold -- after consulting with four experts from other institutions -- expressed full confidence that it's the first of its kind. This optimism stems from the fact Triebold's team isn't just relying on a few assorted bits and pieces of fossils."A lot of times when you find a new species, it's just a scrap," Triebold explained to CNN. "We actually have 85% of the entire body of this animal."The species rebirth began in 2012, when Triebold -- a self-professed "professional fossil hunter" -- and his small team began focusing on an area of "really hard, concrete sand" in Montana's Judith River formation. They coined the nickname "Ava"because, at first, they thought their find was an example of an avaceratops, an existing species.Read More
