(CNN) "The Department of Veterans Affairs appreciates the work of the Office of Inspector General and we will work diligently to address the issues their report raised to continue to improve the enrollment system to better serve Veterans.The OIG's Report Review of Alleged Mismanagement at the Health Eligibility Center discusses issues VA acknowledged publicly last year that our enrollment system management and data integrity and quality are in need of significant improvement. VA realizes the issues surrounding the enrollment process are confusing to Veterans and our stakeholders.VA continues the efforts outlined in previous blogs and public responses to contact Veterans with a record in a pending status (irrespective of whether an application date is present) to determine if they desired to enroll in VA healthcare. We have been reaching out to Veterans to let them know the additional information needed so that we may complete their application. As of June 30, 2015, VA has contacted 302,045 Veterans by mail asking them to submit required documents to establish eligibility. To date, VA has received 36,749 responses and enrolled 34,517 Veterans, and outreach efforts are continuing. As we continue our work to contact Veterans, our focus remains on improving the enrollment system to better serve Veterans.Where issues in the report require additional review and accountability actions, VA will act as necessary and pursue them and afford all concerned appropriate due process.Caring for our nation's Veterans is the highest honor and privilege for the men and women who serve them at VA. Our mission is to provide timely access to earned health care and benefits for millions of Veterans. That is a responsibility that we do not take lightly."
