North Korea has a history of using creative language to express loathing for its enemies. Here are some of the regime's more colorful threats against the West.North Korea warned it would make a "preemptive and offensive nuclear strike" in response to joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises . Pyongyang issued a long statement promising that "time will prove how the crime-woven history of the U.S. imperialists who have grown corpulent through aggression and war will come to an end and how the Park Geun Hye group's disgraceful remaining days will meet a miserable doom as it is keen on the confrontation with the fellow countrymen in the north."
