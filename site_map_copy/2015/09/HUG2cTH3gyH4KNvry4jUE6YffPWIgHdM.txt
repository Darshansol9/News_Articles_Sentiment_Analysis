(CNN) "God weeps" for the sexual abuse of children, Pope Francis said Sunday in Philadelphia, after meeting with victims of sexual abuse.Francis met with five victims, including three women and two men, the Vatican said in a statement.All were adults who suffered abuse as minors, either by clergy, family members or teachers.The Pope listened to the victims' testimony, talked with them both as a group and individually, and then prayed with them.The site of the Pope's meeting, St. Charles Borromeo Seminary, is significant since the local archdiocese was the subject of two scathing grand jury reports, in 2005 and 2011, that uncovered years of inadequate action on the part of church leaders to stop priests from raping and molesting children. The priest in charge of personnel was convicted of child endangerment in 2012.JUST WATCHED Pope Francis meets with victims of sexual abuse Replay More Videos ...

Humbly we owe each of them our gratitude for their great value, as they have had to suffer terrible abuse, sexual abuse of minors," he said.Pope Francis has met with sexual abuse victims before, including at the Vatican in 2014. During a homily given during a private Mass with six victims, Francis apologized and asked for forgiveness.The Pope has met with victims/survivors of abuse this morning. Let us pray for the gift of healing for them and continued work we must do. â€” Bishop Edward Burns (@BishopBurns) September 27, 2015"I beg your forgiveness, too, for the sins of omission on the part of Church leaders who did not respond adequately to reports of abuse made by family members, as well as by abuse victims themselves," Francis said in the 2014 homily, according to a text of the statement provided by the Vatican.In 2008, former Pope Benedict XVI met with sexual abuse victims in Washington.Victim advocates often dismiss such meetings as public relations ploys, and many were particularly upset this week after Francis praised U.S. Catholics' "courage" and "generous commitment to bring healing to victims."Photos: Pope Francis in the United States Photos: Pope Francis in the United States Pope Francis waves from the top of the steps as he prepares to depart Philadelphia International Airport on Sunday, September 27, on his way back to Rome.

"I have come so that we can pray together and offer our God everything that causes us pain, but also everything that gives us hope, so that we can receive from him the power of the resurrection.""Padre, Â¿le puedo dar un abrazo?", le preguntÃ³ un preso al #Papa.

In July, he went to a notoriously violent jail in Bolivia, telling the inmates that he, too, has sinned and been forgiven.The Pope delivered a similar message on Sunday in Philadelphia, telling the 100 inmates gathered in a small room that "life means getting our feet dirty.""All of us need to be cleansed, to be washed," he said.And while Francis avoided criticizing the high incarceration rate in the United States, where 2.5 million people are in prison, he urged the inmates and correctional officers to focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment."This time in your life can only have one purpose: to give you a hand in getting back on the right road, to give you a hand to help you rejoin society," the Pope said.
