Story highlights Volunteers look for signs from the birds to decide when to shut lights offThe lights attract birds ranging from fledgling seabirds to migrating songbirds(CNN) Two illuminated beams honoring victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks went off briefly Friday night after birds drawn to the soaring light got trapped.Hundreds of birds get stuck in the Tribute in Light memorial while migrating through New York City, the Audubon Society said.The birds circle in the light until they get exhausted and confused, causing them to fall down and hit nearby buildings or get severely burned by the lights, it said."This is something that's going on for the past few years, we have a team of scientists and volunteers ... who come up on the roof and count the birds that get trapped in the light," said David J. Ringer, a spokesman for the city's Audubon Society.Lights off for 4th time.
