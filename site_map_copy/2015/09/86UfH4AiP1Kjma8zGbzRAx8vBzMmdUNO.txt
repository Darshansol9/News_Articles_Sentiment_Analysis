Story highlights Pygmy killer whales were found stranded this week in Mississippi bayouThe rare dolphin species comes from the Northern Gulf of MexicoThe mammals are being rehabilitated in Gulfport, MS(CNN) A discovery in a Mississippi bayou is giving scientists a glimpse into a rarely-seen marine species.Attracted to the telltale "swoosh" sound of a blowhole, a fisherman this week found two stranded pygmy killer whales in Waveland, along the Gulf Coast - far from their natural habitat."Very little is known about this species," says Moby Solangi, Director of the Institute of Marine Mammal Studies in nearby Gulfport, Mississippi. He told CNN affiliate WLOX that the discovery is like finding so-called "black boxes" that give insight and history in to an otherwise mysterious sea creature.Even though the animal has "killer whale" in its name, it is a member of the dolphin family. Pygmy killer whales also have a very strange body shape. According to National Marine Fisheries Service "they have a small head with a rounded melon that extends in front of the mouth and there is no discernable beak."The pygmy killer whales were a long way from their natural habitat of deep water in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Their numbers in the region are estimated at just over 400. They are also located in Hawaii and the Western North Atlantic Ocean.Read More
