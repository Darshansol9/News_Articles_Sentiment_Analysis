Story highlights Pope Francis is visiting three East Coast cities in his first visit to the United StatesCNN/ORC Poll: Nearly half of Americans, 78% of Catholics are looking forward to his visitAbout 76% of Catholics say Francis' views are "about right" -- not too liberal or conservative(CNN) As Pope Francis visits the United States for the first time, a new CNN/ORC Poll finds the head of the Catholic Church is largely viewed favorably nationwide and that most Catholics approve of his comments even on controversial issues.And he's arriving in a country that seems glad to greet him: Nearly half of Americans and 78% of Catholics said they were looking forward to the Pope's trip to the United States.Impressions of Francis have gotten slightly less positive since December 2013, about nine months into his papacy, when 83% of American Catholics had a favorable view of him. Still, with nearly three-quarters of Catholics holding a positive view of Francis, impressions of the Pope remain broadly positive.The church itself is viewed positively by 60% of Americans, while 63% view Pope Francis favorably. Among Catholics, the church (88% favorable) outperforms the Pope (74% favorable), though that difference stems more from Catholics who say they're not sure about Francis than from more negative impressions. (To put that in context, just 9% view Francis unfavorably compared to 10% who say they see the church unfavorably.)The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone September 4-8 among a random national sample of 1,012 adults. The sample included 196 self-identified Catholics. For results among the full sample of adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points, it is 7 points for Catholics.Read More
