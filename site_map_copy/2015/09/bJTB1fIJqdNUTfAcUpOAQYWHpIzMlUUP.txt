Story highlights Students reported seeing nooses hanging from a tree on campusPolice say the ropes were not noosesThe ropes were left over from paper lanterns hanging from the tree, police say(CNN) The discovery of what looked like nooses hanging from a tree at the University of Delaware in Newark stirred outrage and anxiety this week, even after police ruled out a hate crime.On Tuesday, a student reported three nooses hanging from a tree on a green space in the middle of the campus. On Wednesday, police said they determined the ropes were not nooses but "remnants of paper lanterns from an event previously held on The Green.""We received several reports from students who said they had seen the materials hanging in the tree," university police Chief Patrick Ogden said. "I am confident that we have determined the origin of these items."Still, the news did not assuage the consternation of some students."I seriously doubt that that was left over from a 'paper lantern event.' How did no one notice that until last night @UDelaware?" one Twitter user said.
