The Pope and the PresidentAfter the Rose Garden ceremony, Francis and President Barack Obama are expected to meet privately in the Oval Office.There are many issues on which both men agree -- and they seem, personally, to get along well.Pope Francis laughs alongside US President Barack Obama upon his arrival at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, September 22.But there are also issues on which the Pope and President disagree, and it will be interesting to see the statements that emerge from the private meeting.Watch, in particular, for references to religious freedom, a big area of contention between the U.S. Catholic bishops and the White House, who have battled over the contraception mandate in Obama's signature health care law.3.

A controversial saintIn his last planned event on Wednesday, Pope Francis will canonize Junipero Serra at a large Mass outside Washington's Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.The canonization is a huge point of pride for Latino Americans, and Serra, an 18th-century missionary from Spain, will be the first saint ever canonized on American soil. But to Native Americans, Serra was no saint. They say he came to conquer and convert their communities.
