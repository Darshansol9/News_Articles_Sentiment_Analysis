Story highlights Russell Taylor's attorney says client expects to spend many years in prison, will accept court's sentenceHe agrees to plead guilty to charges of child exploitation and distributing and receiving child pornographyProsecutors say conspiracy involved former Subway pitchman Jared Fogle(CNN) The onetime director of Jared Fogle's charity has agreed to plead guilty to charges of child exploitation and distributing and receiving child pornography as part of a conspiracy with the former Subway pitchman, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Indianapolis said Tuesday.The plea agreement with Russell Taylor, 43, a former head of the charity focusing on children's health, comes less than two weeks after his friend and once-celebrated face of the sandwich chain pleaded guilty to child pornography charges."Protecting those who cannot protect themselves will always be a priority," U.S. Attorney Josh J. Minkler said in a statement. "Adults who sexually exploit children by producing child pornography knowingly cause vast harm to their victims and should expect appropriately strong punishment."Under the plea agreement, Taylor cannot ask the court for a prison sentence under 15 years in imprisonment. The court will have to approve the agreement -- under which the government will recommend a sentence of up to 35 years in prison plus supervised release for the remainder of Taylor's life."Mr. Taylor takes full responsibility for his role in this matter involving Mr. Fogle," his attorney, Brad Banks, told the media. "Mr. Taylor is agreeing to a plea that contemplates the possibility of him doing a very lengthy amount of time in prison. Mr. Taylor accepts whatever punishment that is handed down by the court."Read More
