Story highlights Goodell: "No connection in my mind" between handling of Spygate and DeflategateNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell says he is open to changing his role in the league's disciplinary actionGoodell says NFL's litigation team will continue the appeals process in the Tom Brady case(CNN) NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, coming off a defeat in court over his handling of the "Deflategate" scandal, says he's open to changing his role in how the league disciplines its players. But he's also now under the microscope for how he handled another New England Patriots scandal eight years ago.On the "Mike & Mike" show on ESPN2 on Tuesday, in his first public remarks since the NFL lost in federal court in the Tom Brady Deflategate case, Goodell said that he is open to changes in the player disciplinary process, with the potential of setting up a panel or discipline officer to handle punishment of players.The process has become "extremely time-consuming," he said. "I have to be focused on a variety of other issues, and that's what I've discussed with many of the owners over the last couple years."Goodell did not say that he was removing himself from power. It would be the process that could change."We believe that the standards of the NFL are important to uphold," Goodell said. "We believe that you don't delegate that responsibility or those standards. We think that somebody with a deep knowledge of the game and our policies and our rules (is) important, particularly when it relates to competitive violations. Those are important to have, so there's got to be a system in there somewhere."
