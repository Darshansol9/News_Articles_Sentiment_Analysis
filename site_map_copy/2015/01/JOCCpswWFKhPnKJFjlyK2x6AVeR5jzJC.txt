He also ran for one score."You prepare all week to find success. And to execute the way we did, it definitely feels good," he told reporters. "Hopefully we can take a little bit of this momentum heading into the next game."Oregon running backs Royce Freeman and Thomas Tyner each scored on two touchdown runs as the Ducks ended the Seminoles 29-game winning streak.Florida State (13-1), the defending national champion, was done in by five turnovers. The miscues included a fumble in the third quarter by quarterback Jameis Winston that was turned into a back-breaking 58-yard touchdown return by Ducks linebacker Tony Washington. Oregon scored four TDs in the third period to lead 45-20 going into the fourth."We just turned the ball over too many times. We had one of the worst quarters we have ever had," Florida State head coach Jimbo Fisher said. "They made the plays, and they converted."Winston, the 2013 Heisman Trophy winner, was 29 of 45 for 348 yards with one touchdown and one interception.In the second semifinal, running back Ezekiel Elliott rushed for 230 yards on 20 carries and had two touchdowns for Ohio State (13-1).

That's how we did it," Ohio State coach Urban Meyer said.Alabama (12-2) gave up 537 yards of offense to Ohio State."It was our goal to play our best in this game so we would have an opportunity to play in a national championship game, but we obviously didn't do the things that we needed to do," Alabama coach Nick Saban said. "But I think there are a lot of winners on this team and I don't think that you necessarily need to get a trophy to be a winner."The two semifinal winners will meet for the championship on January 12 in Arlington, Texas, at 8:30 p.m. ET.
