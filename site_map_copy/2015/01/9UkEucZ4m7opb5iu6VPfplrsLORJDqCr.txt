Story highlights NFL says "evidence thus far supports the conclusion" under-inflated balls were usedThe league says it has hired an investigation firm to help with forensic evidence(CNN) Deflategate is not just a bunch of hot air, the NFL said Friday.The league said the Super Bowl-bound New England Patriots used footballs that didn't meet league specifications in the first half of the AFC championship game last Sunday."While the evidence thus far supports the conclusion that footballs that were under-inflated were used by the Patriots in the first half, the footballs were properly inflated for the second half and confirmed at the conclusion of the game to have remained properly inflated," the NFL's statement said.The statement said the NFL wants to know "specifically whether any noncompliance was the result of deliberate action. We have not made any judgments on these points and will not do so until we have concluded our investigation and considered all of the relevant evidence."Forty interviews have been conducted, the NFL said, but it didn't say whether investigators had talked to star quarterback Tom Brady or coach Bill Belichick.
