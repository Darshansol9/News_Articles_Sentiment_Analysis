Story highlights Problem is with a thrust vector actuator on the second stage, Space X saysSpace X says SpaceX's scheduled launch Tuesday is aborted; next possible attempt is FridayIn a first, the company plans to try to land the rocket's first stage(CNN) Private spaceflight company SpaceX scrubbed a scheduled rocket launch Tuesday, in which it planned to attempt the pioneering step of landing the rocket's first stage on a floating platform.The next possible launch attempt is at 5:09 a.m. ET Friday, NASA said via Twitter, "pending resolution of the issue."NASA and SpaceX said the problem was with the Falcon 9 rocket's second stage, rather than the section it plans to try to land.At 1:21 before launch, a thrust vector control actuator for the Falcon 9's 2nd stage failed to perform as expected. @SpaceX is evaluating. â€” NASA (@NASA) January 6, 2015"During the terminal count engineers observed drift on one of the two thrust vector actuators on the second stage that would likely have caused an automatic abort. Engineers called a hold in order to take a closer look," said John Taylor, of SpaceX communications.The thrust vector control actuators are used to steer the rocket in flight. The second stage of the rocket delivers the payload -- in this case, supplies for the International Space Station -- to the desired orbit.Read More
