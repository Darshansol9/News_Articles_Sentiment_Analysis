It's Tuesday and here are the 5 things to know for your New DayCHARLIE HEBDO CARTOONIf the Charlie Hebdo attackers thought they could eliminate the magazine, they're about to be proven wrong a million times over. Editors of the Paris-based satirical magazine released the cover of their next issue last night, and it shows a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed, holding up a sign with the now-famous slogan "Je Suis Charlie." This issue of Charlie Hebdo is scheduled to be shipped to newsstands today and put on sale tomorrow. Many Muslims find depictions of Mohammed to be deeply offensive, and there has been speculation that Wednesday's attackers were motivated in part by past Charlie Hedbo cartoons. Circulation for this edition is expected to be massive. Three million copies will be printed. A normal run is 60,000 copies.FRANCE - OBAMA SNUBNo-show, no problem?: The Obama administration is taking plenty of heat for The Obama administration is taking plenty of heat for not showing up at the French unity march over the weekend. But most of the hubbub seems domestic in nature, with little coming from across the pond. White House spokesman Josh Earnest acknowledged the slip up. "We should have sent someone with a higher profile," he said. U.S. ambassador Jane Hartley was the top American official at Sunday's events. The no-show made barely a ripple in France which is still focused on the aftermath of last week's terror attacks. Giving the White House some political cover, French President Francois Hollande and French diplomats praised Obama's support. Domestically, it was a different story. Sen. Marco Rubio told CBS it was a "mistake" not to send someone. Sen. Ted Cruz said Obama should have been on the streets of Paris himself. U.S. media took the administration to task too, and analysts said the president missed an opportunity to engage with France.JUST WATCHED Damage control after Obama skips unity rally in Paris Replay More Videos ...

On Monday, searchers recovered the plane's other so-called black box, the flight data recorder, which stores a vast amount of information about the aircraft's performance, including air speed and cabin pressure.JUST WATCHED Official: AirAsia plane exploded after hitting water Replay More Videos ...

He alternated between the breast stroke and backstroke. Jellyfish stung him and he was also circled by a shark. It took him 16 hours to make the trip off the South Florida coastline on Wednesday. Konrad was trying to reel in a fish when a huge wave smashed into the boat. "I quickly realized I was in a real bad situation," he said. He came ashore in Palm Beach. A security guard called police. Konrad was taken to the hospital, where he said he was treated for hypothermia, severe dehydration and rhabdomyolysis, the breakdown of muscle tissue.
