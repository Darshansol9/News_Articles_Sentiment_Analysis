Story highlights A Florida opts not file a formal aggravated assault charge against George ZimmermanA girlfriend recants her claim that Zimmerman threw a bottle at her, she feared himHe became a national lightning rod after being charged, acquitted in Trayvon Martin's death(CNN) George Zimmerman was arrested, again, this month in the suspected aggravated assault of a girlfriend. And, again, a Florida prosecutor has opted not to press formal charges -- after the alleged victim backed off her claims.State Attorney Phil Archer, whose jurisdiction includes Brevard and Seminole counties, announced Friday that his office won't file charges against Zimmerman, who first came to the world's attention for his arrest and eventual acquittal in the 2012 shooting death of African-American teenager Trayvon Martin.Friday's announcement relates to the 31-year-old's arrest in Lake Mary, Florida, on January 9."While it clear that the officers had probable cause to arrest Mr. Zimmerman, which was affirmed by the circuit court judge at initial appearances, the subsequent recantation by the (alleged) victim of her initial statement along with new documents provided by the victim and her attorney precludes my office from proceeding further," Archer said.Zimmerman attorney Don West had told reporters that his client was accused of throwing a wine bottle at a girlfriend. Police learned about it days later after coming "in contact with the (alleged) victim at a traffic stop," Lake Mary police spokeswoman Bianca Gillett said.
