He was involved with model and personality Blac Chyna and their show "Rob & Chyna" followed the couple's tumultuous relationship and the arrival of their daughter, Dream. The couple split and in July 2017 Chyna was granted a temporary restraining order after he posted personal info about her on social media.

"Because it makes him look bad, and he wasn't doing that."A woman said she also saw him take 10 herbal supplement tablets over three days.The brothel's employees said when they found him, Odom was lying in bed on his side with a pinkish fluid coming from his mouth and nose.Photos: Former NBA star Lamar Odom Lamar Odom dribbles the ball during an NBA game against the Denver Nuggets in November 2010.
