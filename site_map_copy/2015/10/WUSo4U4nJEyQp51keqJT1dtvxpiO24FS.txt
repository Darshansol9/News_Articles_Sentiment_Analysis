Aaron Jenkins said.The shark bit the teen "on the left hand and he punched it away and it only bit him one time," Jenkins said. "And then he turned around and paddled to shore and he flagged down one of the beach safety officers and they treated him on scene."Jenkins said the boy had some "pretty significant lacerations" and was taken to Halifax Health Medical Center in Daytona Beach."He was transported just in case. We don't know this for certain, but with the nature of the serious lacerations, he may be looking at ligament damage," Jenkins added.
