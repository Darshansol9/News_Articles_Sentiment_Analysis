Twenty-seven of the train's more than 100 cars came off the tracks. The fire threatened the local water supply and forced hundreds of residents to evacuate their homes. A home was destroyed and one person was injured, officials said.In the months leading up to the derailment, the CSX railroad company and its contractor Sperry Rail Service missed the broken rail during two inspections in December 2014 and January 2015, according to an FRA statement.The disaster prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency and started a domino effect of trouble.JUST WATCHED Watch CNN's report from February's massive explosion Replay More Videos ...
