But whatever happens there, he now looks set to spend the rest of his life behind bars.A judge sentenced Matthew, 33, to three life sentences Friday for a 2005 incident in which grabbed a 26-year-old woman as she was returning from a Fairfax, Virginia, grocery store and sexually assaulted her, the county's Commonwealth Attorney Raymond Morrogh told CNN.Neighbor Stacey Simkins said that he dragged her behind a "dark pool area" before passersby scared him off, according to the FBI.The sentence is the maximum for the charges that Matthew faced, including attempted murder, abduction with attempt to defile and object sexual penetration. Matthew could be eligible to get out when he turns 60 years old -- a geriatric release program that applies to similar cases, Morrogh said.But that doesn't mean he'll get out then, especially considering the other cases against him.
