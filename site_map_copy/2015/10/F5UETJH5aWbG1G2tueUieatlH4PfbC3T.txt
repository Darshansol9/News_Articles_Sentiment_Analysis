(CNN) For years, millions of viewers have followed Lamar Odom's every move -- from the two-time NBA champ's layups on the basketball court to his highly publicized romance with reality TV star Khloe Kardashian.But now Odom is far from the spotlight's glare, with those closest to him remaining tight-lipped as he fights for his life at a Nevada hospital.Officials have said little about how he ended up there -- and what his current condition is, days after he was found unconscious at a brothel about an hour from Las Vegas.The manager of the brothel, Love Ranch in Crystal, Nevada, says Odom was there "to get far away from something."In three days, Odom spent $75,000 there, the price that guaranteed two women would "take care of any of his needs," owner Dennis Hof told CNN's sister network HLN.He used cocaine on his first day at the brothel Saturday, employees told 911 dispatchers, according to authorities. On a 911 call played at a news conference, a woman said she also saw him take 10 herbal supplement tablets over three days.The brothel's employees also told 911 operators that when they found him Tuesday, Odom was lying in bed on his side with a pinkish fluid coming from his mouth and nose.As details eked out about what may have led to Odom's hospitalization, members of the Kardashian family have revealed few specifics to their millions of social media followers, instead posting photos of happier times as they rallied support and pushed for prayer.Kourtney Kardashian shared a photo of Odom hugging one of her children."Believing in the power of prayer for this beautiful soul," she wrote.Believing in the power of prayer for this beautiful soul. pic.twitter.com/r4u4IM3PWT â€” Kourtney Kardashian (@kourtneykardash) October 15, 2015Odom's father and two children have been with him at the hospital, along with the Kardashians.In a statement released through their publicist Thursday afternoon, Destiny Odom, Lamar Odom Jr. and their family asked for prayers."Thanks for your outpouring of prayers and support for our dad.

It lasted for two seasons and 20 episodes.The two signed divorce papers this year, but the divorce has not been finalized, a source told CNN.As a result, the source said, Kardashian will make medical decisions for the former NBA star.The Kardashians have also rallied to support Odom.
