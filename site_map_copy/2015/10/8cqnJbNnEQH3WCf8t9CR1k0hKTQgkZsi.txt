MUST WATCH High school football player dies after injury in game 00:51Schools lack full-time trainersThe reason for the high number of high school football fatalities compared with college and the pros comes down to numbers.There are about 1.1 million high school football players in the nation, compared with about 100,000 in the NFL, college, junior college, arena football and semiprofessional level, the NCCSIR survey found.High school football players suffer three times as many catastrophic injuries -- deaths, permanent disability, neck fractures and head injuries -- as college players, according to a 2007 study in the American Journal of Sports Medicine.Kevin Guskiewicz, co-director of the Matthew Gfeller Sport-Related Traumatic Brain Injury Research Center at the University of North Carolina, said the developing brains of high school athletes are more vulnerable to catastrophic head injuries.In addition, the skill level of many younger athletes leaves them more susceptible to serious injuries.Making matters worse, nearly 70% of high school athletes with concussions played despite their symptoms, and 40% reported that their coaches didn't know of the injury, according to a 2014 study in the American Journal of Sports Medicine.The risk of serious injuries and death at the high school level is exacerbated by the shortage of full-time athletic trainers at practice and games -- due largely to costs.A study this year in the Journal of Athletic Training said only 37% of the nation's public high schools have full-time athletic trainers."Nearly all of the causes of death in sport are influenced by the care in the first five to seven minutes," said one of the study's authors, Douglas Casa, a professor of kinesiology at the University of Connecticut.Safer than ever?The five leading causes of death among high school athletes are cardiac conditions, heat stroke, sickling, and head and spinal cord injuries, according to Casa, who's also the chief executive officer of UConn's Korey Stringer Institute , which researches sudden death in sport."They are all impacted by the level of medical care. Sickling and heat stroke are 100% survivable with proper recognition and care, and cardiac is over 90%."Exertional sickling is a medical emergency in those carrying the sickle cell trait, according to the institute. It occurs when red blood cells change shape, causing a buildup of the cells in blood vessels and leading to decreased blood flow."These events are incredibly tragic," Dawn Comstock, an associate professor at the University of Colorado's Colorado School of Public Health, said of the deaths."I would love to never see another high school athlete die while they play their game but the positive benefits of playing sports in terms of lifelong health are greater."Comstock and other experts believe schools without full-time athletic trainers should disband their football teams.Still, the past 10 years have seen significant changes intended to make the game safer for young athletes, according to experts.Every state and the District of Columbia now has some type of sports concussion law, the National Federation of State High School Associations says . The laws cover issues like removing athletes with suspected concussions from play and concussion education programs for coaches, though the laws vary significantly from state to state.This year, the organization recommended limits on the number of days per week that football coaches hold full-contact drills."High school sports are probably safer than they've ever been," Guskiewicz said.
