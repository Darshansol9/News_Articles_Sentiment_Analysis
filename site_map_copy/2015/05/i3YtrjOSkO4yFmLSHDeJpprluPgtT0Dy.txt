Story highlights A recent eruption sent molten lava and rock fragments flyingOfficials say the lava lake at the Kilauea summit is rising to record heights(CNN) The lava lake at a popular Hawaii tourist destination is rising to record heights.The latest eruption occurred at the Kilauea summit lava lake Sunday night across from a visitors center. But never fear, said Janet Babb with the U.S. Geological Survey. The overlook at the Jaggar Museum at the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is more than a mile away from the crater and officials don't believe visitors are in danger.Gas building up inside the crater's lava bed caused the dramatic eruption, which hurled molten lava and rock fragments 285 feet to the top of the rim, she said."When a rock falls into that lake, it causes a reaction," Babb said, "much like if you were to uncork a bottle of champagne by hitting the top off with a hammer."And for onlookers eager to catch a glimpse of bubbling lava, the recent activity has indeed been cause for celebration.
