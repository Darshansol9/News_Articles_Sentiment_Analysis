Hattiesburg, Mississippi (CNN) Investigators haven't detailed exactly what they think happened before two Mississippi police officers were shot dead during a traffic stop.But now they say even though four suspects have been charged in connection with the case, just one of them is accused of pulling the trigger.Marvin Banks, 29, appeared in court on Monday and was charged with two counts of capital murder, along with counts of grand theft auto and being a felon in possession of a firearm, Mississippi Bureau of Investigation spokesman Warren Strain said.Preliminary autopsy findings revealed that one officer was shot in the back, and the other was shot in the face, Strain said.Investigators haven't said what motive they believe Banks had for allegedly opening fire, or specified what role the other suspects played in the shooting. Tests have begun on boxes of evidence, but it could be weeks before the results come in, Strain said."There are theories, but we'll wait on the forensics to come back," Strain told reporters.Marvin Banks' half-brother, 26-year-old Curtis Banks, was charged with accessory after the fact of capital murder, Strain said.Joanie Calloway, 22, was originally charged with two counts of capital murder, but her charges were reduced in court on Monday to accessory after the fact of capital murder, Strain said.Cornelius Clark is charged with obstruction of justice.None of the suspects entered pleas in court Monday. As deputies escorted him into a police station Sunday, Curtis Banks wailed and repeated "I didn't do it."Slain officer had 'fire in his soul' for police workTate, they said at a vigil honoring the slain officers, was a rookie cop known for his big smile and the joy he got from blaring his cruiser's siren as he fulfilled a lifelong dream of being on the force.Deen was a self-described "country boy" who loved busting gangs and became the department's police officer of the year after rescuing a family from a burning home.A funeral for Deen, a K-9 officer who was married with two children, is scheduled for Thursday.At Monday's vigil, his colleagues described him as an officer who made many drug arrests with his dog, Tomi, at his side."He loved to fight gangs," Assistant Chief Frank Misenhelter said.
