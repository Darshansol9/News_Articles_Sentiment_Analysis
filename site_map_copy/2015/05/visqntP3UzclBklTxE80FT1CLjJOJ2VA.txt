MUST WATCH Atlas V rocket carrying 'secret' space plane lifts off 01:58The Air Force space plane is actually called the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle . This is the fourth mission for the plane. It looks like a small space shuttle, but it doesn't have a crew. It can stay in space for years at a time. The last mission ended in October 2014 after 674 days in orbit. The plane is controlled like a drone and lands like an airplane. The media nicknamed it the "secret space plane" because the Air Force won't say much about what it does once it gets into space.The X-37B will ride into orbit on top of the Atlas rocket's second stage, called the Centaur. The 10 CubeSats will ride on the bottom of the Centaur inside a compartment called the aft bulkhead carrier, or ABC. During launch, the compartment holding the space plane and the CubeSats will be protected by a white shell called a payload faring.
