His staff would say in the 80s Leno was most consistent #AskJake — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) May 19, 2015.@FauxctCheck i cover hard news every day at 4 and my last 4 docs were on Bergdahl, Paris attacks, & 2 Medal of Honor recipients. #AskJake — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) May 19, 2015.@IreneAnnHunt Unclear if Regis will pop in on last show -- there will be surprises, I'm told. #AskJake — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) May 19, 2015.@zini989 No doubt he's been freer about sharing his political views in recent years, and many conservatives have been turned off. #askJake — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) May 19, 2015.@katiebailey4 All I can tell you is now he takes some SSRI, does meditation & therapy, and seems happy in fatherhood @AskJake — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) May 19, 2015.@twiztedziztah watched him in jr high/high skl/college in 1980s-early 90s. was surprised to learn how miserable he was then. #AskJake — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) May 19, 2015.@rodsandguitars @zini989 Letterman indeed made a horribly inappropriate joke about Sarah Palin's daughter. He apologized. #AskJake — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) May 19, 2015.@Andrew_Patrick that's a great question -- i dont know.
