Story highlights State law doesn't allow criminal charges against 8-year-olds, prosecutors say1-year-old's death might have been averted if moms had checked on kids after club, police sayCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported the charges involving the 8-year-old suspect. The child has been accused of juvenile delinquency, according to the Jefferson County, Alabama, District Attorney's office.

Sean Edwards of the Birmingham Police Department told reporters Tuesday.The girl's mother, 26-year-old Katerra Lewis has been charged with manslaughter, police say. She is out of jail on a $15,000 bond. The 8-year-old's case will be handled in juvenile court, authorities say, where criminal charges are not allowed.

Lewis left Kelci under the supervision of her roommate's children, all far too young for the responsibility, police said.Read More
