Story highlights DA: The money helps cover the costs of fixing damage the escapees did to their cells, steam pipeMitchell, a former prison worker, will pay $79,841 restitution plus a 10% surchargeA judge has said New York state incurred $23 million in overtime costs tied to escape(CNN) Former New York prison worker Joyce Mitchell will have to pay authorities more than $80,000 for her part in helping two convicted murderers escape.At a court hearing Friday, Clinton County prosecutor Nicholas Evanovich called the payment -- $79,841 restitution plus a 10% surcharge -- the maximum amount allowed under the law. Mitchell's attorney, Stephen Johnston, consented to the restitution and said his client would withdraw a related appeal."This now brings to an end a difficult time for our community," Clinton County Judge Kevin Ryan said at the close of the brief court hearing. "And I am pleased that an agreement was reached relative to restitution."On June 6, other prison workers discovered that inmates Richard Matt and David Sweat had broken out of the upstate New York's Clinton Correctional Facility. Their escape spurred a massive, three-week long manhunt that culminated when police shot and killed Matt, then recaptured Sweat two days later.Photos: Manhunt for escaped New York prisoners Photos: Manhunt for escaped New York prisoners Richard Matt, left, and David Sweat were on the run after they escaped from the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York, on Saturday, June 6.
