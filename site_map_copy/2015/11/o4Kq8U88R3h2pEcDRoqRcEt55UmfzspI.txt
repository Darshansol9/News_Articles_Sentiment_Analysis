Story highlights Someone placed tape over portraits of black faculty members at Harvard Law SchoolCampus police investigating it as a possible hate crime, school says(CNN) Harvard University police are investigating a possible hate crime at the law school after someone covered portraits of black faculty members in tape, according to university officials.Some photographs, housed in Wasserstein Hall on the Cambridge, Massachusetts, campus, were defaced with strips of black tape and discovered Thursday morning. No suspect had been identified, according to Michelle Deakin, a spokeswoman at Harvard Law School.According to an article on Harvard's website, the portraits are a part of a long-standing tradition at the school with roots in the 1800s. More than 180 faculty members from throughout the law school's history are on display. Only black professors had their faces covered in tape.Harvard Law School students quickly rallied in solidarity with their professors. A.J.
