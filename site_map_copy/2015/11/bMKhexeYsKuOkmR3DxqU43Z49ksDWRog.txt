Story highlights At least 12 cars disappeared into the holeNo one was injured, CNN affiliate WTOK reports(CNN) A large "sinkhole" opened in a new IHOP restaurant parking lot in Meridian, Mississippi, over the weekend, swallowing as many as 12 cars, according to CNN affiliate WTOK.The asphalt gave way Saturday evening, leaving a huge hole estimated to be about 35-feet wide, 375-feet long and 30-feet deep, authorities said.Emergency officials roped off the area to keep people away, WTOK reported .

Crews will begin trying to remove some of the cars Monday, the mayor added.While the event was first blamed on a sinkhole, Dr. Greg Easson of the University of Mississippi's Geology and Geological Engineering Department said that's not accurate.
