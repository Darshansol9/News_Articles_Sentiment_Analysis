"We share the concerns of many Americans that extremists are creating a poisonous environment that feeds domestic terrorism in this country. We will never back away from providing care in a safe, supportive environment that millions of people rely on and trust."Cowart told CNN she believes all staff and patients from the clinic are accounted for."We're still reaching out to confirm individuals, how they are. I believe no one of our staff was severely injured. I also believe at this time that none of our patients were injured," she told CNN.Officer was a six-year veteranThe slain officer, 44-year-old Garrett Swasey, worked for the University of Colorado in Colorado Springs and was on campus about 10 miles away when the shooting broke out.

Then she heard the gunfire."I heard a bullet go right by the door and hit something," she told CNN. "And I ran back to my desk and grabbed a bunch of keys and fumbled at the door trying to find one to lock it. ... As I was doing that I was seeing the police commotion outside, police running everywhere, ducking behind cars with guns."Denise Speller, who works at a salon, said she heard at least 10 gunshots go off and saw a police officer get hit."It was terrifying," she said.Joan Motolinia said he got a phone call Friday afternoon from his sister, who was inside the clinic."I heard the shooting," he said, choking up as he described the situation to reporters. "She couldn't say too much because she was afraid."In a nearby grocery store, an announcement over the intercom told shoppers they weren't allowed to leave. They huddled with staff at the back of the supermarket.It was shocking to watch SWAT teams while holed up inside a nail salon, witness Jill Lavelle said."Seeing the SWAT members squatting down in their shields and their riot gear, with their automatic rifles out, that was very ... I never have experienced anything like that before," she said.Despite initial fears that the shooter could be on the loose outside, authorities now believe he remained inside the Planned Parenthood building throughout the siege, Buckley said.Several injured victims made their way into a nearby bank, she said.Attack comes as Planned Parenthood faces criticismHours after the shooting began, video from CNN affiliates showed people in medical scrubs and white coats being escorted from the scene.Planned Parenthood is a national health care provider that delivers reproductive health care and sex education to women and men throughout the United States. The organization runs nearly 700 health centers throughout the United States, according to its website.The group says each year 2.7 million people in the United States visit its health centers for health care services and information. Abortion is among the services Planned Parenthood clinics provide, an issue that's made the organization a target in the past.It's faced sharp criticism in Washington and from some Republican presidential candidates on the campaign trail after an anti-abortion group released a series of videos alleging that Planned Parenthood engaged in the selling of fetal organs and parts for profit.Planned Parenthood has strongly disputed the videos and contended the tapes provide a distorted account because they are heavily edited.At least three Planned Parenthood buildings have been vandalized since September.
