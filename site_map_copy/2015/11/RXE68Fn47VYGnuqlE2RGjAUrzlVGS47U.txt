But for photographer Hatnim Lee, it is so much more. It is also a place for portraiture.Lee started taking photos of customers at her parents' liquor store in Washington about 15 years ago. The title of her photo series, "Plexiglass," comes from the fact that the majority of Lee's portraits were made from behind the store's acrylic glass -- a solid, transparent plastic used for security."It's just kind of interesting," Lee said.
