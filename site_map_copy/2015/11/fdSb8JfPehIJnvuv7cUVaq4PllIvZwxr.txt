(CNN) Perhaps it was inevitable given the religion of the Paris attackers.Still, the enormity of the backlash is head-spinning.Words of hate ooze from the pages of social media - drenched in xenophobic bile.But at the same time, there have been instances of compassion, of understanding and of love from surprising quarters.For Muslims, both citizens and residents of the United States, the backlash isn't surprising.

"I don't care if they are f***ing 2-years-old or 100. I am over your f***ing s*** and our whole country is."Hassan Shibly with the Council on American-Islamic Relations call such acts "a form of terrorism.""That's un-American. It's disgusting. It's horrific," he told CNN."We can not allow enemies abroad to divide us here at home. There's no room for that kind of violent rhetoric in our civil society."The attacks on Muslims and mosques come at a time when the number of hate crimes in the United States is down overall - but anti-Muslim ones are up.Anti-Muslim hate crimes rose by 14% last year, according to the FBI's annual Hate Crime Statistics ReportActs of loveBut it's not all bleak.Even with all the suspicions, there were acts acceptance and understanding too.At the Texas mosque where feces was smeared on the door, 7-year-old Jack Swanson felt bad about what happened and donated $20 from his piggy bank, affiliate KXAN reported"It's 20 bucks, but coming from Jack collecting his pennies, it's worth 20 million bucks to me and to our community," said Faisal Naeem, a mosque board member.At Florida State University, Muslim students handed out 150 bags of candy.

I see terrorists when I look at ISIS," Philistine Ayad, a Muslim feminist, told CNN . "To me, terror knows no religion. They are picking and choosing aspects of the religion and twisting and distorting them in order to justify their actions that are unjustifiable.""If the #NotInMyName campaign can help expel some of that Islamophobia and expel some of my fear ... then that would be wonderful."
