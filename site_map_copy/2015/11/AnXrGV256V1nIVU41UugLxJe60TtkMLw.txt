(CNN) "SIU Carbondale was notified in September that it is the subject of a U.S. Department of Education Title IX investigation in relation to a sexual assault case. The university is fully cooperating with the investigation. Due to legal and privacy concerns, we cannot confirm the specific case that is subject of the investigation, and we cannot respond to questions regarding the details of any individual case.The university takes all reports and investigations of sexual assault very seriously. Our staff members are well-trained, and we have policies and procedures in place to ensure that all parties in the process are treated fairly and respectfully. Like campuses across the country, we are working very hard to fulfill our responsibilities to students through education, prompt response and thorough investigation."
