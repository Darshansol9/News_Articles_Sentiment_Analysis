Story highlights D.A. acknowledges that some people demand a homicide charge"That is not possible under Colorado law without proof of live birth," he saysDynel Lane is held on $2 million bond in an attack on a seven-months' pregnant woman(CNN) Dynel Lane, a former nurse's aide accused of stabbing a pregnant Colorado woman, was charged Friday with criminal attempt to commit first-degree murder, unlawful termination of pregnancy, and other crimes for allegedly cutting a fetus from the womb.Boulder County District Attorney Stanley L. Garnett was unable to file a murder charge under state law, and he highlighted how the coroner found that the fetus didn't show any signs of life outside the womb, Garnett said.The victim, Michelle Wilkins, 26, who was seven months' pregnant, survived this month's attack, which occurred when she went to a Longmont home to buy baby clothes advertised for sale on Craigslist."Now, I understand that many in the community -- and heaven knows I've heard from a lot of them -- would like me to file homicide charges," Garnett told reporters."However, that is not possible under Colorado law without proof of live birth. A prosecutor cannot file murder charges when a baby who is killed has not lived outside the body of the mother. For similar reasons, I cannot bring charges of child abuse resulting in death," the district attorney said.
