(CNN) There were 10,000 runners and walkers at the Rodes City 10K on Saturday. Asia Ford was among the last. But a photo of her finish has caused a sensation online, thanks to a police officer who kept her going when she was about to give up.The race in Louisville, Kentucky, was another milestone for Ford, who has lost 217 pounds in her quest to live a healthier life for her children.According to CNN affiliate WAVE-TV , Ford trained for months for the event. But around mile 5, breathing became a challenge."I messed up and forgot to eat this morning," she wrote on her Facebook page , adding that she was still recovering from a bout of pneumonia.As she struggled to finish, to move forward and to catch her breath, her son Terrance stepped in to offer a supporting hand. Emergency medical service crew weren't far behind, just in case.But Ford wouldn't let breathing problems or an empty stomach hold her back.Louisville police Lt. Aubrey Gregory was impressed."The EMS guys got out to check on her, and she said I'm not stopping, I'm not stopping," Gregory told WAVE-TV. "So I said I'm not going to let her stop, we're going to do this together. So I got out and I grabbed her hand. I had to meet this inspirational woman."What a compassionate city looks like: Lt.
