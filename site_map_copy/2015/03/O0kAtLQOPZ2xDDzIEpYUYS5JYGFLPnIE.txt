Story highlights Media coverage of ISIS could spur "real wave of Islamophobia," report's editor saysThe number of hate groups across the U.S. dropped 17% from 2013 to 2014, the report saysIn particular, the number of KKK chapters dropped from 163 to 72 in a year, it says(CNN) America may be growing less hateful.That's according to an annual Southern Poverty Law Center report that says the number of hate groups in the United States remains on the decline for the second year in a row.In the "Intelligence Report" released Tuesday, the SPLC says the number of hate groups operating in the U.S. declined 17% between 2013 and 2014.
