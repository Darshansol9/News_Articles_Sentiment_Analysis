(CNN) Two years ago, Aaron Hernandez had a $40 million contract and was a rising NFL star. Now the former New England Patriot is on trial in the killing of Odin Lloyd.Lloyd, a semipro football player, was shot multiple times on June 17, 2013. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty.Here are some of the key moments from the past week of his murder trial:Victim's sister can talk about the textsJudge Susan Garsh on Monday reversed her initial ruling to block any mention of multiple texts from Lloyd before he was slain.Lloyd's sister, Shaquilla Thibou will be able to say she received four texts from her brother just minutes before his death.The last text came at 3:23 a.m., a minute before workers in the industrial park where Lloyd's body later was found heard gunshots.Thibou had been expected to testify Friday, but that testimony was delayed as the court proceedings focused instead on exploring critical cellphone records.Thibou will not be able to talk about the nature of the texts, including this one that prosecutors say was from Lloyd: "U saw who I'm with... Nfl... just so u know."The judge ruled it would be too prejudicial against Hernandez.#AaronHernandez "U saw who i'm with...nfl..just so u know" jury wont hear content; will be told Lloyd texted 4x; final text at 323 — susan candiotti cnn (@susancandiotti) February 23, 2015Gunshots 'like fireworks going off'Two plant employees working the overnight shift at Needletech Products Inc., a company in the industrial park where Lloyd's body was found, reported hearing loud bangs at the time he was thought to have been fatally shot.One worker, Barbara Chan, said she was napping in her car during her lunch break between 3 and 3:30 a.m."I heard a loud band, maybe four or five times," she testified Monday, saying she thought it was fireworks."It was two slow ones and three fast ones," she added.Another plant worker, Michael Ribeiro, said he heard about six or eight loud bangs just after 3:20 a.m."A loud banging sound, like fireworks going off," Ribeiro testified.JUST WATCHED Why was Aaron Hernandez taking apart his phone?
