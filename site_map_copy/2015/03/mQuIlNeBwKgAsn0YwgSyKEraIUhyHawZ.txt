Story highlights Firing squads will be allowed in Utah if drugs for lethal injection can't be obtainedLethan injection remains the primary method for executions in the state(CNN) Utah's governor signed a bill Monday that brings back firing squads as a potential way to execute some death row prisoners.Lethal injection remains the primary method for carrying out executions in the state, Gov. Gary R. Herbert said in a statement. A firing squad would only be used in the event the necessary drugs cannot be obtained."Those who voiced opposition to this bill are primarily arguing against capital punishment in general and that decision has already been made in our state," said Marty Carpenter, a spokesman for Herbert."We regret anyone ever commits the heinous crime of aggravated murder to merit the death penalty and we prefer to use our primary method of lethal injection when such a sentence is issued.
