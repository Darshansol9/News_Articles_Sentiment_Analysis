"We're in the business of expunging snow!"Read MoreHis business slogan: "Our nightmare is your dream!"At first, ShipSnowYo sold snow packed into empty 16.9-ounce water bottles for $19.99, but the snow usually melted before it reached its destination.Packing shipments as we speak!

But he has no shortage of product."At this rate, it's going to be July until the snow melts," he told Boston.com. "But I've thought about taking this idea and running with it for other seasonal items. Maybe I'll ship some fall foliage."
