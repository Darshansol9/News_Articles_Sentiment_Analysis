(CNN) Nothing seemed unusual Wednesday when the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Norman, Oklahoma, picked up what appeared to be rainclouds over western North Texas.Nothing unusual ... except the clouds weren't rain."We didn't have any clouds yesterday to form anything like that," said Jonathan Kurtz, a meteorologist at the Norman Forecast Office . "Our first indication was some kind of biological feature."What the radar was picking up was bugs, lots and lots of them. Grasshoppers and beetles were flying between the ground and 2,500 feet, covering an area of about 50 miles.Check it out!

The bugs were flying at different elevations, not in a massive cloud as it appeared on radar."It doesn't take a whole lot of bugs to cause that on radar," Kurtz said. "It's not like biblical proportions. There was just enough out there that the radar picked it up."
