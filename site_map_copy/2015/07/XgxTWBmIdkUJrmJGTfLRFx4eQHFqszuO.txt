And here, I just gave America your cell phone number." And that has pretty much been the level of discourse in the GOP presidential race the past couple of days. Donald Trump gave out South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham's number during "You're a jackass." "Well, you're an idiot. And here, I just gave America your cell phone number." And that has pretty much been the level of discourse in the GOP presidential race the past couple of days. Donald Trump gave out South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham's number during a rally yesterday in the state. (We called the number. It went to voicemail and the mailbox was full.) Trump also called Graham an idiot during the rally, retaliation for Graham calling him a jackass on Monday, which was retaliation for Trump slamming Sen. John McCain. Graham later tweeted that he might be in the market for a new cell phone.Probably getting a new phone. iPhone or Android? â€” Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) July 21, 2015LEPROSYSkin shocker: Leprosy is Leprosy is on the rise in Florida , and it's because of armadillos. Wait, what? Wasn't leprosy a disease from the Bible days that had long since been vanquished? And armadillos? What the heck? Well, people still contract leprosy. There are 50 to 100 cases per year in the United States. In a typical year Florida has two to 12 cases, but there have been nine so far this year. Experts think the spike is because folks are having increased contact with armadillos, some of which are naturally infected with the disease. And why the increased contact? Ever growing development in the Sunshine State is destroying armadillos' natural habitat.JUST WATCHED Armadillos blamed for leprosy increase in Florida Replay More Videos ...

The shooter, a parks and recreation employee, said he shot them because he was tired of "homeless" people causing problems in city parks. But the victims were Native American, causing some to think the shooting was racially motivated. Tribal leaders want a hate crime investigation. If that were to happen, it would have to be on the federal level because Wyoming doesn't have a hate crime law.
