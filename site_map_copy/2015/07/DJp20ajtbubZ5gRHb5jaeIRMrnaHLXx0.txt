Story highlights Tennessee governor moves National Guard recruitment centers to armoriesMilitary forbids service members from carrying weapons on bases and in recruiting centersCivilian guard movements have popped up around the United Stated in protest(CNN) "I'm here to protect our military because they're not allowed to protect themselves," Texan Orlando Perez told CNN affiliate KRGV-TV.Perez is one of many gun-toting civilians across the country who have taken it upon themselves to guard members of the military in the wake of last week's shooting in Chattanooga, Tennessee , that left five service members dead.These civilian guard movements began in part to protest the military's policy of forbidding service members from carrying weapons on bases and in recruiting centers. The civilians have said the policy is unreasonable and leaves members of the military vulnerable to attack.But the military is not welcoming the civilian guards.A Navy official told CNN on Wednesday that should unauthorized armed civilians attempt to patrol outside a Navy recruiting center, recruitment personnel would try to work elsewhere. They could choose to spend the day at a school, mall, on travel or other duties that would keep them away from the center.
