Story highlights Planet is closest rocky planet outside our solar systemScientists expect to be able to learn a lot about the planet because of its location(CNN) Astronomers have confirmed the discovery of the nearest rocky planet outside of our solar system.The planet orbits a star in another solar system about 21-light years away. It cannot be seen from Earth with the naked eye. The planet is bigger than Earth, but it's too close to its star to sustain life.The newfound world doesn't have a very good name yet -- it's just called HD 219134b. The planet was first detected using the Galileo National Telescope in the Canary Islands. NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope confirmed the finding.Why is this faraway planet so important?Because scientists say it will be easy to study right here from Earth. The planet sits at just the right angle to detect it when it passes in front of its sun and that will let scientists learn a lot about the planet's size and composition.
