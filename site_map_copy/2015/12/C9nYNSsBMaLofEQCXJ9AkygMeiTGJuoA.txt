It ended in a mistrial in December, and he had been scheduled to be retried before prosecutors dropped the charges against him. Porter was summoned by the van's driver to check on Gray during stops on the way to a police station. Prosecutors said Porter should have called a medic for Gray sooner than one was eventually called, and they said he also should have ensured that Gray was wearing a seat belt. Porter had been charged with involuntary manslaughter, second-degree assault, reckless endangerment and misconduct in office.

"If some choose to demonstrate to express their opinion, that is their right, and we respect that right, and we will fight to protect it. But all of us today agree that the unrest from last spring is not acceptable."Davis sent a letter to the police force on Monday, saying, "Regardless of the outcome of this trial or any future trial, we refuse to surrender to the low expectations of those who wish to see us fail. ... We serve because we know so many good and decent Baltimoreans need us to stand in between them and crime, disorder, and chaos."Baltimore police canceled leave for officers who had days off from Monday through Friday. Officers will be scheduled to work 12-hour shifts instead of the usual 10 hours.'How long does it take to click a seat belt?'During closing arguments, prosecutor Janice Bledsoe argued that any officer in Porter's situation would have called for medical assistance once Gray complained."'I need a medic,'" the prosecutor said, quoting Gray. "How long does that take? How long does it take to click a seat belt and ask for a medic? Is two, three, maybe four seconds worth a life? That's all it would have taken."JUST WATCHED Active Baltimore police officers speak on riots, crime Replay More Videos ...

"He's the peacemaker."Baltimore police Capt. Justin Reynolds also testified for the defense, explaining that the "transporting officer" is responsible for those taken into custody. Porter was not the transporting officer in Gray's case.When Porter helped Gray onto a bench in the wagon during one of the stops that April day, he did more than he was required to do, according to Reynolds."He went beyond what he could have and still kept within the policy," Reynolds testified.Porter, 26, has said Gray was kicking the inside of the police van en route to the station, and he had tried to kick out the window of a patrol car during an arrest a few weeks earlier.Report finds gaps in unrest preparednessAuthorities say Gray broke his neck on April 12 while being transported in the police van, shackled but not wearing a seat belt.

This is a pivotal point for the city, said Davis. "People who find themselves in the midst of a historic moment don't always realize that they are in the midst of a historic moment," he said, "I realize that's where we are." Davis is starting by establishing relationships with various groups in the community to prevent the type of unrest the city experienced in April and May.

All of the students come from the immediate neighborhood in west Baltimore. Her students perform better than many of their counterparts, but unfortunately, it is not rare for them to be touched by the prevalent violence in the community. During the unrest earlier this year, "they were frightened because they didn't know what was going to happen," Neilson said.

He says the biggest lesson that Baltimore can take away from the year's events is "that you can only ignore a group of people for so long."

Baltimore is rich with culture, compassion and love, McKenney said. "No matter where I go, I'll always be Baltimore." Hide Caption 11 of 11An independent report by researchers at Johns Hopkins University released Friday cited gaps in Baltimore's preparedness for the unrest.The researchers made recommendations similar to those in an earlier report, including the development of policies for mass demonstrations and improved intelligence-gathering, according to a statement from Rawlings-Blake, the mayor. Many of the recommendations have already been implemented.Porter's testimonyDuring his four-hour testimony Wednesday , Porter said that of the roughly 150 prisoners he has placed in police wagons since joining the Baltimore Police Department in 2010, none was secured with a seat belt -- in part, out of concern for officers' safety while in the wagon's tight quarters.Prisoners were never secured with seat belts during field training, and though cadets were instructed to secure prisoners with seat belts, they were not shown how, Porter said."It is the responsibility of the wagon driver to get the prisoner from point A to point B," he told the jury.Prosecutors say Gray didn't get the medical help he asked for during one stop of the van. An autopsy showed his spinal column was "functionally" severed. The cause of his death was a neck injury, and the manner of his death was homicide, a medical examiner testified earlier this month.Porter has testified that Gray didn't ask to be transported to the hospital until the fourth of six stops along the 45-minute ride to the police station. Porter relayed the information to the driver, he testified, but he didn't call a medic because Gray didn't appear to be injured and didn't articulate what was wrong.
