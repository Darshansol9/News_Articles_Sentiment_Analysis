Story highlights Suspect Robert Dear interrupts hearingHe could face the death penaltyPlanned Parenthood CEO says "hateful rhetoric" fuels violent incidentsColorado Springs, Colorado (CNN) Robert Lewis Dear, accused of killing three people last month at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado, made a series of outbursts at a hearing Wednesday, saying, "I am a warrior for the babies."On a day on which prosecutors filed 179 felony charges against him, Dear, wearing an aqua jumpsuit and leg irons, made his thoughts known -- through nearly 20 interjections during the proceeding."You'll never know what I saw in that clinic," Dear interrupted during one argument in the motions hearing. "The atrocities. That's what they want to seal. The babies."At other times, he said, "I am guilty. There is no trial," and "Protect the babies."A bailiff sitting nearby several times placed a hand on Dear's shoulder in an apparent attempt to quell the disruptions.
