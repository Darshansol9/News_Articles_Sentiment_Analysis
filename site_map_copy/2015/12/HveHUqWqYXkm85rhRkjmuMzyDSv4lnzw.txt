(CNN) During his presidency, President Barack Obama has had to deliver statements on gun violence 15 times.After a gunman opened fire at Oregon's Umpqua Community College, killing nine people and injuring seven, a visibly upset Obama said the shootings were becoming all too routine.The gunman also died, although it's unclear whether he was shot by police or committed suicide."The reporting is routine," Obama said. "My response here at this podium ends up being routine, the conversation in the aftermath of it. We've become numb to this."He then asked news organizations to tally up the number of Americans killed through terrorist attacks in the last decade and compare it with the number of Americans who have died in gun violence.
