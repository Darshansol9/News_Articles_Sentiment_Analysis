Story highlights Stephanie Ready works as a full-time analyst for the Charlotte Hornets on FOX Sports SoutheastReady was the first woman to coach a men's professional sports team when she was an assistant in the NBDLOn how it feels to be the first full-time female NBA analyst: "Awesome"(CNN) Trailblazing isn't new for Stephanie Ready.Her most recent accomplishment? Breaking yet another glass ceiling in the sports world. She works as a full-time analyst for the Charlotte Hornets on FOX Sports Southeast and is the first full-time female NBA game analyst for a team's local broadcast.However, after starting her new job, Ready, in a sit-down interview with CNN's Andy Scholes in late October, says she hasn't seen the Hornets' owner -- Naismith Memorial Basketball hall of famer Michael Jordan -- in person.

She was the first woman to coach a men's professional sports team when she was an assistant coach with the NBA Development League's Greenville Groove in 2001. Before that, she was the third female on a Division I men's basketball staff when she was an assistant at Coppin State for two seasons; she also was the first woman to be a full-time recruiting assistant.
