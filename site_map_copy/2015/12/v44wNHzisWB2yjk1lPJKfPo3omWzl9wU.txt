(CNN) The Navy's newest ship, the littoral combat ship USS Milwaukee, broke down on Friday and had to be towed to a base in Virginia, the Navy Times reports.The $360-million ship was commissioned last month in Milwaukee and was on its way to its home port of San Diego. The long journey took it through the Great Lakes and to Halifax, Canada.The ship was on its next leg, from Halifax to Florida, when it "suffered an engineering casualty," the Navy Times reports.The ship had to be towed more than 40 nautical miles to the naval base in Little Creek, Virginia.The Navy Times reported that the initial indication is that metal debris collected in an oil filter, causing the system to shut down, though the source of the fine metal debris was not known.
