(CNN) Six people died in flash floods on rural Missouri roads overnight, according to Pulaski County Sheriff Ron Long. Long told CNN a vehicle carrying two adults was carried away by rising flood waters, and in a separate incident, another vehicle carrying at least four people also was swept away by rising flood waters. "Streams turn into rivers, and people sometimes don't see the road has flooded over when they are driving at night," Long said.
