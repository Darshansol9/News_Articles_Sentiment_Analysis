Photos: Michael Peres has been photographing snowflakes under a microscope for 13 years. Every time it snows in Rochester, New York, he runs outside, ready to photograph the tiny flakes. Hide Caption 1 of 10Photos: He catches the tiny flakes on black velvet and moves them over to a clean microscope slide with a dissecting needle.

Hide Caption 3 of 10Photos: It the air temperature is in the upper 20s, Peres says he has 30 seconds to capture it. If it's colder than that, he can have up to 2 minutes to photograph the flakes. Hide Caption 4 of 10Photos: When he has a flake on a slide, it quickly starts evaporating. Here you see the process of sublimation, when a substance goes from a solid to a gas, skipping the liquid phase. "They are getting tinier while I shoot. It makes focusing exciting." Hide Caption 5 of 10Photos: To keep the flakes from melting quickly, Peres says "everything has to be cold," from the catching tray and the velvet, to the slide and the microscope. Hide Caption 6 of 10Photos: To capture different colors, he uses newspapers, envelopes and other items as a backdrop for the snowflake. Hide Caption 7 of 10Photos: Peres rigged his Nikon camera to his "homemade" microscope to capture these images. He set a macro lens on a bellows.
