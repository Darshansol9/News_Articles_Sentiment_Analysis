"The operator left the train to execute that procedure. Bypass mode allows the train to depart the station, even if it's not receiving the signal that it would otherwise use to operate on its own."The requirements to put the train into bypass mode include initiating the full service brake, as well as a hand brake, MBTA Chief Operating Officer Jeff Gonneville said. Whether proper procedures were followed is under investigation."Operator error is the current focus of the investigation," Pollack said.Read More
