Story highlights Rice says Gadhafi once showed her a video montage during a visit to LibyaHe played the video montage to a tune called "African Flower in the White House""I had actually known that he had this fixation on me," she saysFormer Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice described Moammar Gadhafi's crush on her as "weird and a bit creepy," saying she breathed a sigh of relief when she realized a video he made of her was not raunchy.In her new book, "No Higher Honor: A Memoir of My Years in Washington," Rice said the ruler once played her a video montage of herself set to a tune called "African Flower in the White House."A Libyan composer wrote the song, she said.Earlier this year, anti-Gadhafi fighters ransacking his compound in Tripoli found an album of photos of the former top Bush administration official."Quite extraordinary, weird and a bit creepy, " Rice told CNN's Piers Morgan on Wednesday night about the scrapbook. "I had actually known that he had this fixation on me."Rice said when Gadhafi showed her the video montage years ago in Libya, she tried to keep the conversation on business."My job was to go there and do diplomatic business and get out, so that's what I did," she said. "But I have to say I did have that terrible moment when he said that he had the video. I am just glad that it all came out all right."JUST WATCHED Condi Rice denies Cheney claim Replay More Videos ...

"I don't like it when people say that the criticism of President (Barack) Obama is because he is black. The criticism is because he is the president, and we tend to criticize our presidents."Rice said Cain is "an interesting person. He has an interesting background. Obviously, a lot of business experience. He is sort of shaking up the race. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing."
