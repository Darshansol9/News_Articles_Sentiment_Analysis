If restaurants and chefs across America worked with their local Boys & Girls Clubs and followed our program, we could feed millions of children.I feel like I'm a voice on this Earth and my mission is to tell people: "Let's step forward. Don't just talk about it. Do something about it." We can make this a better place to be and fight the poverty in our country.CNN: How will you use the $50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 CNN Hero?Serato: It will help me to keep doing what I do and serve more children in need. I also hope to travel to promote the program and make more people aware of our national "motel kids" problem.CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work?Serato: In America, in our own backyards, we have kids who go to bed hungry. If we do something about it, we will have no hungry children in America.If you give up one cup of coffee a day, you can feed 10 kids. One bag of pasta costs a few dollars, and that can serve 10 kids.If I can feed more than 300 kids alone, all together we can feed millions.
