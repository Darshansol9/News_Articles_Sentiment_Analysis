A lesbian couple was crowned Homecoming king and queen at a San Diego high school, CNN affiliate KGTV reported, but since then, the school has received "hateful" calls and e-mails, many of them from adults who live outside of San Diego. In a statement, San Diego schools Superintendent Bill Kowba said the response from "adult bullies" is disrupting the school after a "happy and positive" event.
