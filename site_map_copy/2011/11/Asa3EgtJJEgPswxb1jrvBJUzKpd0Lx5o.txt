Story highlights Employees testify in OSHA hearing into the death of a killer whale's trainerThey testified that trainers are taught to recognize signs of aggressionOSHA has cited SeaWorld for not having adequate safety precautionsIn 2010, Dawn Brancheau was pulled underwater by a killer whale and drownedSeaWorld employees on Tuesday testified at a federal job safety hearing that, while the behavior of killer whales is is extremely predictable, the job of working with a 6-ton marine mammal carries a calculated risk.The hearing, before the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Review Commission, resumed Monday after a two-month hiatus. It was convened to look into the death of SeaWorld Orlando trainer Dawn Brancheau, 40, in February 2010.OSHA attorneys called three witness -- all from SeaWorld San Diego, including the California park's vice president. SeaWorld strongly objected to the California employees being called as witnesses in a case involving only the Florida theme park.The administrative judge allowed the questioning to go forward, but reiterated his final ruling would only concern the SeaWorld Orlando's operations.SeaWorld employees testified that trainers of killer whales are taught to recognize "precursors" -- odd behaviors that could lead to aggression. OSHA attorneys reviewed multiple SeaWorld incident reports in which trainers missed aggressive behaviors.JUST WATCHED Court views earlier SeaWorld death Replay More Videos ...

It is unclear how many witnesses SeaWorld will call.The hearing is schedule to conclude Friday.After court was adjourned, Dawn Brancheau's family issued a statement through their attorney, saying their "interest in the case is the safety of the current and future SeaWorld employees and their hope (that) no other family will have to suffer like we have had to," said attorney John Mills.The family has acknowledged that SeaWorld surveillance video showing the trainer's death might be shown during the trial, but they hope it will not be released to the public.
