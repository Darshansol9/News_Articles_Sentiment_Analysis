Marra was trapped in the craft's back seat as it sank, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said.Helen Tamaki, 43, died the following week.A source close to the investigation identified Harriet and Paul Nicholson, one of now two survivors, as Marra's mother and stepfather. Tamaki was a family friend, according to the source. The pilot, Dudley, is the other survivor.A 15-member team from the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash, which happened shortly after takeoff from a riverside helipad.U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, who represents Manhattan's East Side in Congress, said in a previous statement that she was "saddened and deeply concerned" about the crash."There have been at least 28 helicopter crashes in our city over the last three decades," she said. "Federal transportation officials should investigate not only the causes of this crash, but also whether it is safe to have such a high volume of helicopter traffic over our densely populated city."
