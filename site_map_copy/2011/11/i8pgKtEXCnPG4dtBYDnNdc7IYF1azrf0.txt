Bill Smith has been the chef at Crook's Corner, a restaurant in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, for nearly two decades. In 2011, Crook's Corner was honored with The James Beard Foundation's America's Classic Award - a distinction for locally owned restaurants "beloved in their regions for quality food that reflects the character of their community," according to the Foundation."In a restaurant kitchen, chances are good that your dishwasher won’t speak English as a first language. There are lots of reasons for this," Smith says."For starts, you can wash dishes in any language so a lack of English needn’t be a hindrance to the new arrival. I’ve been a chef for over 20 years. Here are five things to be said in favor of continuing this custom, offered in a time when people are being very snippy about these very nice people."
