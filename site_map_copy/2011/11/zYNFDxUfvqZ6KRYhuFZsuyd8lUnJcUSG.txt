Editor's note: The NewMe Accelerator brought together eight black entrepreneurs for a two-month immersion in tech startup culture -- a culture dominated by young males, mostly white and Asian. These two entrepreneurs founded the accelerator. Watch how it turns out when Soledad O'Brien reports the documentary, "Black in America: The New Promised Land - Silicon Valley," at 8 p.m., 11 p.m., and 2 a.m. ET on February 11 and February 12.
