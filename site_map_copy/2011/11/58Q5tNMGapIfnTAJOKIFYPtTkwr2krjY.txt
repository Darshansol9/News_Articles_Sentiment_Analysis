Story highlights Academy bought movie for visitors center, TV commercials for Navy sporting events"The cost of the commercials and motion picture was excessive," official saysFilm was waste of $3.5 million; academy mission, career paths not portrayed well, report saysThe U.S. Naval Academy wasted millions of dollars trying to polish its image on a movie for its visitors center and television commercials to run during Navy sporting events, according to a new watchdog report."The cost of the commercials and motion picture was excessive," the Defense Department inspector general says about the 2008 projects. Two years earlier, the Naval Academy had produced a visitors center film for $200,000 and recruiting commercial for $14,000."We concluded that the USNA (United States Naval Academy) wasted $3.5 million because the short motion picture did not adequately describe the USNA mission and did not portray all the USNA career paths," the report says. "The USNA decision to contract for the production of a short motion picture and six television commercials was deficient and the expenditure of DoD funds was careless and extravagant."This report follows one by the Navy inspector general. But the new report found that additional corrective actions were required.
