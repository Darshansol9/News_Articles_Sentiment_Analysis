Story highlights Among the new additions are an eagerly-anticipated Tim Burton creationForecasters predict sunny skies50 million people are expected to watch from homeThe Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, as much a holiday tradition as turkey, football and dinner table debates, celebrated its 85th anniversary with a host of new floats and balloons that began making their way down New York City's streets Thursday morning.Making its return after an 18-year absence is Sonic the Hedgehog. He joins a 41-foot-tall Julius the monkey; an eagerly-anticipated newcomer, "B," a pointy-toothed, stitched-face creation from filmmaker Tim Burton; and the Aflac Duck Balloonicle -- a balloon on wheels.Rounding out the newbies are Gazer the Elf and Harold the Policeman."It's amazing to see them come to life," Amy Kule, the parade's executive producer, told CNN affiliate WABC. "They start off as ideas in your head, they become a drawing on a piece of paper. And then miraculously, the magicians at the Macy's parade studio build them and bring them to life."In all, more than 50 balloons will grace the Manhattan sky during the parade.JUST WATCHED Elmo's best way to get a parade spot Replay More Videos ...
