Story highlights Former landfill in the U.S. using solar sheets to power local homesTen acres of plastic sheets fitted with photovoltaic cellsWaterproof sheets also trap methane which is also collectedEPA estimate there are 100,000 closed landfills in the U.S.Hickory Ridge landfill was once a mountain of trash sitting idle on the outskirts of Atlanta, Georgia.But now, with its 10 acres of solar panels, the old landfill has been given a new lease of "green" life."When a landfill is (finished with) taking waste, it basically is dormant and there's not a lot of uses for the property," says David Stuart, area environmental manager of landfill owners, Republic Services, Inc."But its natural attributes -- being a tall structure, out of the shadows of the tree line -- gives it a unique advantage as a solar project," he added.The Spectral PowerCap designed by the Carlisle Energy Services is lined with 7,000 flexible solar strips which produces one megawatt of energy.The electricity generated is collected in each panel much like a solar calculator would, says Stuart. But rather than powering a keyboard it goes towards helping power the local grid.Beneath the solar panels, gas pumps have been driven deep into the ground collecting methane gas, which is also used for power production.The liner made of thermoplastic polyurethane is similar to that used on commercial rooftops and is designed to keep water out and methane gas in.As the waste breaks down the liner flexes to maintain a snug fit.JUST WATCHED Solar landfill has green energy covered Replay More Videos ...

Many are close to urban areas and power lines.Landfills are a constant reminder of the waste we produce but projects like these could help dispose of the view that they are simply costly eyesores.
