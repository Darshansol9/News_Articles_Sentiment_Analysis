Americans are divided over whether churches and clergy have provided enough moral leadership on the country's economic problems, according to a recent survey.Forty-six percent of respondents in a Public Religion Research Institute poll released Thursday indicated that churches have not provided enough leadership during the financial crises. Forty-five percent indicated the opposite.This division, which is within the survey's plus or minus 3 percent margin or error, was seen throughout almost all religious denominations, including Catholics, evangelical Protestants and mainline Protestants. With 64 percent responding that churches had not done enough, minority Protestants were the only denomination to not show a division within the margin of error.The same survey shows a religious community that is unsure of the Occupy Wall Street movement.Thirty-four percent of minority Protestants, 30 percent of mainline Protestants, 29 percent of Catholics and 18 percent of evangelical Protestants indicated that Occupy Wall Streets message did not share their values.That uncertainty extends outside the religious community, too. The PRRI survey indicated that three-in-ten respondents said their values were in line with those of the Occupy movement.The Occupy movement, which celebrates its two-month anniversary Thursday, is an international protest movement that has called for a number of different reforms, including resolving income inequality and modifying the tax code.Thought respondents said their beliefs didn't align with the Occupy movements, the idea of inequality, when asked on its own, did survey positively."Majorities of nearly every demographic group -- including all major religious groups, age groups and education groups -- agree that the government should do more to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor," reads the survey.Over two-thirds or 67 percent of respondents said the government should do more to reduce the gap between rich and poor. Less than one-third said the government should do less.Public Religion Research Institute conducted the survey of 1,002 adults from November 10 to the 14 by phone.
