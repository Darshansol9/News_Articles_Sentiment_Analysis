Marsh of northern Florida said that, under U.S. law, the painting cannot be returned to Italy until the ownership disputes are resolved."Our interest is strictly to follow the law and safeguard this work until the courts determine rightful ownership," Marsh said in a statement. "Through this process, all rightful claimants may be heard, and we can rest assured that justice will be done for all parties involved in the dispute."Authorities allege that the painting was among the plundering of art and other valuable items from the estate of Federico Gentili di Giuseppe, who died in Paris of natural causes in 1940, just months before the Nazi army invaded France in 1941, authorities said.Before the invasion Nazi invasion, Gentili's children and grandchildren fled France and escaped to Canada and the United States, authorities said. Other family members, unable to flee, died in concentration camps, authorities said.The grandchildren have been taking legal steps internationally to recover the possessions taken during the Nazi occupation, prosecutors said."In a landmark 1999 decision relating to World War II plunder, a French Court of Appeals forced the Musee de Louvre in Paris to return five paintings to the Gentili family, and ruled that the auction of the Gentili estate in Nazi-occupied France was an illegal forced sale and a 'nullity,' " U.S. prosecutors said in a statement.
