It’s funny how now I can call the 12-year period -- from writing the first words to the book’s publication — a “journey.”In all honesty, that time was difficult and frustrating. When I was stymied by writer’s block and when the publisher rejections piled up, I was sometimes depressed and sometimes just filled with despair. Would my dream ever come true? Would the work ever pay off?As I map out new dreams for my writing career, I am remembering those difficult times and trying to plan for them. And mostly, I’m remembering why I’m in this business at all: for the joy of it all – for the joy of connecting with readers – and maybe, just maybe, creating an inner revolution in just one person out there.
