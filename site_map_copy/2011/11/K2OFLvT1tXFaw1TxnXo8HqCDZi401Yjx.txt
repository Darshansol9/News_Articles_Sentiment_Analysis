Story highlights An AK-47-style rifle was recovered, a Secret Service official saysThe reports of gunfire set off a flurry of police activityNo evidence has been recovered that a gun was actually fired, police sayShots were reported fired Friday night between the White House and the Washington Monument, setting off a flurry of law enforcement activity, a U.S. Park Police spokesman said.The incident was reported shortly after 9 p.m., according to Sgt. David Schlosser, spokesman for the Park Police. Responding officers found an abandoned vehicle in the vicinity of the reported incident and were searching it "trying to figure out what happened."Schlosser noted that "no evidence" has been recovered to indicate shots were actually fired."I think, obviously, the thing that makes it of interest is simply the location, you know, a bit like real estate," Schlosser told reporters. "The fact that this occurred outside the White House area. At this point, we don't think that there's any link to the White House."A Secret Service official who asked not to be identified reported that gunshots rang out as two cars sped on the National Mall. Agents stationed on 16th Street heard the shots, then saw the cars heading west on Constitution Avenue, the official said.At least one witness saw that someone had "jumped out of the vehicle and ran," but no one was captured, the official said.An AK-47-style rifle was recovered in or near the abandoned vehicle, the official said.In a brief appearance before reporters, Schlosser said he was not aware of any gun having been found.
