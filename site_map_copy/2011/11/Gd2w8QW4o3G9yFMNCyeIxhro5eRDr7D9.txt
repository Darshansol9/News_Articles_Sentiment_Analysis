Story highlights Police are investigating what authorities say could be a hate crimeThe attack occurred in a Jewish section of Brooklyn, New YorkThree cars were set ablaze and anti-Semitic graffiti was scrawled across park benchesPolice are investigating what authorities say could be a hate crime in a Jewish section of Brooklyn, New York, after three cars were set ablaze and anti-Semitic graffiti was scrawled across park benches.Police said they responded to emergency calls pertaining to the case early Friday morning.The city's Hate Crimes Task Force is "actively investigating the twisted person or people who attacked cars, benches, and a sidewalk on a block of Ocean Parkway early this morning," New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement.Hate crimes are defined as criminal acts committed against those who belong to certain social, religious, ethnic or other group."The fact that this most recent attack came on the heels of the 73rd anniversary of Kristallnacht may or may not be a coincidence," Bloomberg said. "Either way, this kind of hateful act has no place in the freest city in the freest country in the world."The infamous Kristallnacht attack in Germany occurred when Nazi-supported mobs attacked Jewish people and destroyed their property on November 9 and 10, 1938.
