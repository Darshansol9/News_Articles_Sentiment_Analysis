“This city with the country’s oldest Chinatown appears likely to elect a Chinese-American mayor for the first time on Tuesday, and for many residents it is a milestone long overdue.” -- The New York Times“New estimates released Monday show that the number of Americans living in poverty was higher than previously estimated, and stands at 49.1 million, according to the Census Bureau .

He didn't return to Seattle, his old stomping ground, but to his ancestral village in southern China. It was his third trip back, though his first since being appointed ambassador.” --National Public Radio“Don't look for macaroni and cheese, hamburgers or tuna melt sandwiches at the renovated dining commons at UCLA's Rieber Hall dormitory. Instead, a hungry student will find such dishes as spinach and seaweed roll, pork ramen with miso, Buddha's delight and chicken tikka masala. The upscale dining hall, which opens this week, is part of a trend by colleges nationwide to replace old-style cafeterias and 'mystery meat' offerings with innovative, often ethnic fare more likely to appeal to undergraduates' increasingly sophisticated palates and desire for healthier food. … The changes at Rieber are also a response to demographics: About 40% of UCLA's 27,000 undergraduates are Asian American or international students from Asia.” --The Los Angeles Times
