Chaz Bono is an LGBT rights advocate, an author, a recent "Dancing with the Stars" cast member and the only child of entertainers Sonny and Cher. On November 27, "Being Chaz," a documentary follow-up to the Emmy-nominated "Becoming Chaz," will debut on The Oprah Winfrey Network. It follows his life after transitioning from female to male.He's in the public eye now, but grew up in the limelight of a very different America -- ethnically, racially, socially. When CNN Entertainment asked Bono to discuss his view of todayâ€™s America, he said the country has progressed, but is more divided than he ever thought it could be.
