"As everyone can appreciate, this is a deeply personal matter for my parents, and we simply ask that his privacy be respected as he proceeds with treatment."Paterno, 84, the all-time winningest football coach in Division I history, was fired last week amid the outcry over the handling of the abuse claims.Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen said."It is such a difficult, difficult cancer to beat," she said.

He said he had done "what I was supposed to do." In a later statement, he said "with the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had done more."It was years before law enforcement learned about the allegation.Friday's announcement coincides with news of an NCAA investigation at Penn State."This unprecedented situation demands the NCAA evaluate the university's accountability" and application of NCAA bylaws, NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a letter to the school.
