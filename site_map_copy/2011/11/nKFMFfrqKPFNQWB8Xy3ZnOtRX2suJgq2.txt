Story highlights Spacecraft in "excellent health" as it flies toward MarsA rover called Curiosity will roll over the Martian surfaceCuriosity will study whether there's "a potential habitat for Martian life"A NASA spacecraft carrying a Mars rover was in "excellent health" Saturday more than two hours after it began its eight-and-a-half-month journey.The mission began at Cape Canaveral, Florida, with a clean liftoff. The spacecraft sent a signal after separation from the rocket, NASA said.Upon arrival after its 354 million-mile trip, the rover will collect rocks and soil on the Red Planet to see if there are signs of life -- in the form of organic material.The rover, dubbed "Curiosity," is scheduled to land August 6, 2012.It will be lowered by tether to Gale Crater. If water ever existed on Mars, scientists say, it would have been in the crater.JUST WATCHED 'Curiosity' can motivate kids in science Replay More Videos ...
