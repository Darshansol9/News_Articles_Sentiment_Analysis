John Randolph, known as "Jay Smooth" to listeners of his hip-hop radio show and viewers of his Ill Doctrine vlog , speaks in this TEDx Talk about the best way to talk about race: "So I know that this is no small task, but if we could shift a little bit closer, toward viewing these race conversations the same way we view a conversation about something stuck in our teeth, it would go a long way toward making our conversations a bit smoother and allow us to work together on bigger issues around race." -- Ill Doctrine/TEDx
