Laughlin could not confirm the report of flames, but said crew members reported smoke in the cabin following the incident.Passenger Ginger Heath said the incident began with a shaking sensation, followed by "sparks, a great big boom and lots and lots of fire" from the engine. "After that smoke starting coming out of the air vents."Other passengers told CNN affiliate WBTV that they heard a "huge crashing sound" and felt what seemed like "bad turbulence.""I kind of thought I was going to die for a second," one passenger interviewed by WBTV said."A couple of people got hysterical," passenger Atiim Browne told WSOC. "The lady behind me was crying. A couple of people kind of looked at it, you know, as life flashing before their eyes and stuff like that. But again we got back on the floor within a couple of minutes so it wasn't too bad."Delta mechanics were inspecting the aircraft Friday, Laughlin said.
