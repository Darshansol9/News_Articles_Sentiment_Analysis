Widows were arriving as I was on the phone.Words truly cannot describe what this means to me, my fellow widows, our husbands and all the healing and camaraderie that will come from this amazing platform and honor. The (Hero) title, though, should be Heroes, as it is a title that encompasses not only my life, love and dedication, but that of every widow that is a part of the American Widow Project and each of the heroes whose lives and legacies they carry on.CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean to the What do you hope this recognition will mean to the American Widow ProjectDavis: This means that more widows will know they are not alone. It may seem like a simple statement, but more than 3,000 widows had their lives changed with two men at their door. After they get that news, the real struggles start. And that's where the American Widow Project comes in.CNN: How will you use the $50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 CNN Hero?Davis: It will be an integral part in helping facilitate the daily running of the American Widow Project, but most importantly it will go toward our events for the widows throughout the country. We cover all costs for their time with us, so the only thing they need to worry about is healing and connecting with their fellow widows.With nine to 10 events held nationally throughout the year -- with hopes to do more -- these are a major aspect of the organization and connecting this generation's widows. This money will truly go toward not only saving lives, but the legacies of our nation's heroes.CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work?Davis: The wounds from those affected by these conflicts, many can be seen with the naked eye.For this generation's military widows and widowers, their wounds can't be seen (even) though they are some of the most severe. It is due to that fact that most of those suffering from the most major of losses don't receive the support and compassion they so deeply deserve.The work the American Widow Project does recognizes their sacrifice, survival and perseverance and allows them to find healing in a title they never thought they'd hold.
