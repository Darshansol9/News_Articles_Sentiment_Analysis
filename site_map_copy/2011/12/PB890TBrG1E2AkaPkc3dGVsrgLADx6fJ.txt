Actress Tori Spelling and her husband, Dean McDermott, created "Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood", which premiered November 29 at 10/9c on Oxygen.The family plays and works together. Tori, Dean, Stella, and Liam show viewers what a family living and working in Hollywood is all about.When CNN asked them about their children being exposed to ethnic diversity, Spelling said she often jokes that one day when they are old enough to even realize there is ethnic diversity, "they won't even know the differences because it all seems normal.""Hopefully that next generation won't have to go through not being able to come out, being bullied, because everyone will think that this is just the way [they] were raised, everything is the norm," Spelling said.
