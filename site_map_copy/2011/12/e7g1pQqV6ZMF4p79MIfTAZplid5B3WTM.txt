Story highlights A Boston judge rules against demonstrators stayingA midnight deadline passes without police moving inSome tents and trash are cleared from the siteProtesters have been encamped in the square since late SeptemberOccupy Boston protesters remained firmly entrenched in a downtown city square early Friday after a midnight deadline passed for them to clear out or face eviction.Demonstrators cleared trash and some of the more than 100 tents from the area, but most stayed put. Police presence was light around Dewey Square.Superior Court Judge Frances A. McIntyre ruled Wednesday that demonstrators' First Amendment rights do not extend to seizing and holding areas on which they sit.Authorities are "obligated by law to preserve Dewey Square as a space open to the public," McIntyre added.Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who in the past has appeared to tolerate his city's chapter of the nationwide movement, recently signaled that the park could be a safety hazard as winter weather rolls in."We're asking them to leave, according to their own will and volition," Menino told CNN affiliate WCVB. "After that, we'll make decisions about how we'll clear off the site in the future."JUST WATCHED Gov. Chris Christie responds to hecklers Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Gov.
