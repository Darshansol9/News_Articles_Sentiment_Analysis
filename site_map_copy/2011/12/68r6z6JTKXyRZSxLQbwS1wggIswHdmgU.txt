Story highlights Stratfor: Launch is delayed until a thorough review by expertsThe U.S.-based company is providing a year of free identity monitoring to its subscribersEarlier this week, a group claimed it had released Stratfor's subscriber dataThe hacking group Anonymous appears to be distancing itself from the cyber attackStratfor, a global intelligence company, is delaying the launch of its website following an apparent computer hack that saw the release of subscriber credit card information."As part of our ongoing internal investigation, we have also decided to delay the launching of our website until a thorough review and adjustment by outside experts can be completed," Kyle Rhodes, a Stratfor spokesman, said late Wednesday.The delay is expected to take about a week, though it could be longer, Rhodes said.U.S.-based Stratfor, which provides independent analysis of international affairs and security threats and describes itself as a publisher of geopolitical analysis, said it was also providing its subscribers a year of free identity protection monitoring, he said.The company is working with law enforcement, including the FBI, following the security breach, Rhodes said.A posting earlier this week on the information-sharing website Pastebin said that Stratfor subscriber data, including information on 4,000 credit cards and the company's "private client" list, had been released. The posting cited AntiSec, a Web-based collaboration with the activist hacking groups Anonymous and LulzSec.But Anonymous distanced itself from the hack, according to a news release posted on Pastebin."Stratfor is an open-source intelligence agency, publishing daily reports on data collected from the open Internet," the posting said."Hackers claiming to be Anonymous have distorted this truth in order to further their hidden agenda, and some Anons have taken the bait.""The leaked client list represents subscribers to a daily publication which is the primary service of Stratfor," it continued. "Stratfor analysts are widely considered to be extremely unbiased. Anonymous does not attack media sources."Stratfor has said that the security breach occurred Saturday, though a number of consumers have said the breach occurred at least a week earlier.
