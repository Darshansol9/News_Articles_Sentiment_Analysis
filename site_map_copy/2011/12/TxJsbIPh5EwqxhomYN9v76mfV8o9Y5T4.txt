He joined the Penn State football program after graduating college in 1960, taking over as the team's head coach in 1966.JUST WATCHED Fans react to Paterno's cancer diagnosis Replay More Videos ...

Ten additional charges were levied this month.An investigative grand jury's summary of testimony claimed that Sandusky engaged in fondling, oral sex and anal sex with young boys.One of the allegations came from 2002, when a graduate assistant told Paterno he'd witnessed an incident in a shower inside a school athletic facility -- a story that Paterno referred to Athletic Director Tim Curley, but didn't become known to investigators until years later.Curley and Gary Schultz, a university vice president, were both charged with one count of felony perjury and one count of failure to report abuse allegations.Paterno wasn't charged, saying he did his duty by referring the allegations to his superior, according to the grand jury report. But criticism quickly mounted, and Penn State trustees dismissed Paterno and school President Graham Spanier -- who initially backed Curley and Schultz -- days after Sandusky's arrest.Just over a week after the firing, Paterno's son Scott announced that his father has a treatable form of lung cancer. The family learned of the diagnosis after Paterno's follow-up visit for a bronchial illness.
