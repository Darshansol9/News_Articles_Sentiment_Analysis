McIntyre.Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, who in the past appeared to tolerate his city's chapter of the nationwide movement, later signaled that the area could be a safety hazard as winter weather rolled in, imposing a Thursday deadline for the group to clear out or face eviction.By Friday, however, protesters remained firmly entrenched in more than 100 tents.Saturday's arrests was the city's second large-scale action against demonstrators since the movement began there in late September.In October, 129 people were arrested during a march in which protesters allegedly blocked traffic and refused to disperse.The movement, which first sprang up in a Lower Manhattan park, seeks to highlight what it sees as corruption and growing income disparities between the nation's richest 1% and the rest of the country.
