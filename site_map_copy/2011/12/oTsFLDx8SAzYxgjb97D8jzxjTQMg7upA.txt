Kat Chua wrote the play "Undocumented," about the experiences of undocumented immigrants living in the United States. It was inspired by a project she worked on as a student at New York University -- and her own story. Chua was born in the Philippines, and brought to New York at age 8.Although the play's characters think the DREAM Act could change their futures, the play isn't really about the legislation, Chua said."It's not about one solution fixing everything," she said. "It's about the fact that there is a population of the country, of this world, that isn't represented, that is trying to obtain rights."
