"I changed my heart years ago," Bryon Widner said.Widner was former skinhead and neo-nazi, covered in racist tattoos and filled with hate. He had a change of heart, though, and sought to remove the tattoos -- a way to show on the outside how he'd changed inside.He is now starting a new life with his wife and children, although his family is still sometimes harassed, and many wonder whether he could really change."The only way to defeat hate is through love," Widner said.
