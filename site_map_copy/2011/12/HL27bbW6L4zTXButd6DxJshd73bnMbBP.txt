"We are the bearer of each others' burdens... (called) to care for each other as deeply as we can."Neither Sandusky nor his wife Dottie have been to church since the charges were filed last month, parishioners said.Asked after the service if Sandusky should be forgiven, even if the allegations against him are proved true, Zeiders said yes.He quickly added that forgiving does not mean forgetting, nor that people should not be held accountable.Zeiders declined to say who initiated his daily contact with Sandusky and would not describe the content of their conversations.A grand jury report says Sandusky molested young boys after developing close relationships with them through a charity he founded for at-risk youths.Pennsylvania's attorney general charged Sandusky, 67, with 40 counts in what authorities allege was the sexual abuse of eight young boys over several years.Some churchgoers said they were still in a state of shock about the accusations against Sandusky, which he has denied, and some said the charges don't jibe with the Sandusky they know.They seemed mixed on the question of whether the congregation would welcome Sandusky back.Before leaving the church on a recent Sunday, a member of the congregation gave a CNN reporter a coffee mug emblazoned with the name St. Paul's.Inside was a card with the service schedule on one side and a message on the other: "Do you know that God's love can and does achieve great things, even amid the turmoil of today's world?"
