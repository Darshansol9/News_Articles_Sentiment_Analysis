They were quickly swept over.Park officials said in a statement Monday that a body found by a park ranger last Tuesday was determined to be that of Ninos Yacoub, 27, of Turlock, California. The man's body was found in the Merced River about half a mile below the base of the waterfall, the statement said.Yacoub was with Hormiz David, 22, of Modesto, California, and Ramina Badal, 21, of Manteca, California, when the three disappeared over the waterfall. David's body was recovered in August about 240 feet from the base of the waterfall.A third body was found last Saturday in the same general location of where Yacoub's body was located, park officials said Monday, and authorities are likely to make a positive identification "within the next several days."
