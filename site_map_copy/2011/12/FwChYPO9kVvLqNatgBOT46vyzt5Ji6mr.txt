It also maintains employer-paid health care coverage."The new contract is not just an important victory for office cleaners and their families, but for our economy and our city," said Hector Figueroa, secretary-treasurer of 32BJ, in the statement."In these tough times, the workers who keep New York City's corporate offices and landmark buildings clean and well maintained have stood up for the good middle class jobs our economy and our city needs."The cleaners at the center of the negotiation work in more than 1,500 office buildings in New York.Local 32BJ bills itself as the largest private sector union in New York State and has more than 120,000 members nationwide.
