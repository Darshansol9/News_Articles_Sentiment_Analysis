Musician Lenny Kravitz grew up in a house with a white father -- TV producer Sy Kravitz -- and a black mother, actress Roxie Roker, who played half an inter-racial couple on the 1970s show "The Jeffersons.""Kids used to call me 'zebra' or 'panda' ... my mother was 'Mrs. Night' and my father was 'Mr. Day,'" Lenny Kravitz told Piers Morgan , "but it never bothered me."But there's no question, Kravitz said, that race relations in the United States have improved.
