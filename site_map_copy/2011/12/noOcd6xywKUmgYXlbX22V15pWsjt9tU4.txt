Don Wilton, who shared a passage from the book of Ephesians: "For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all God's people, I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers.""Given the outpouring of love and well-wishes Mr. Graham has received from people around the world, the verse seemed to have special meaning to him," Ross said.Ross said that as Graham and his daughter were channel-surfing to find a news broadcast, they came upon a broadcast of Graham's 1973 crusade in St. Louis."It was a blessing to Mr. Graham to realize his preaching still reaches around the world," said Ross, "and even into hospital rooms like his."Graham was hospitalized in May for treatment of pneumonia.

"I was asked in an interview if this was our last crusade and I said it probably is -- in New York. But I also said, 'I never say never.' "
