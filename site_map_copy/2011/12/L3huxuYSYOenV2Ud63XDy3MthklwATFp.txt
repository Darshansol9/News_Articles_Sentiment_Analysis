by Donna Krache, CNNAccording to the CEP, an estimated 48% of American schools are not making Adequate Yearly Progress, or what is known as AYP. This number is an all-time high and up from the previous yearâ€™s estimate of 39%. The most recent data was collected in the 2010-11 school year and the report notes that these are just estimates provided by the states. The official numbers will be released next year.Under NCLB, states are required to set proficiency goals for students through testing or other performance assessments and report those metrics to the Department of Education. The ultimate objective is to meet the NCLB goal of 100% proficiency for all students in math and reading by 2014.In September, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan announced that states could apply for waivers as a way to offer some flexibility regarding NCLB. That action has been met with both praise and criticism from policymakers, educators and parents.
