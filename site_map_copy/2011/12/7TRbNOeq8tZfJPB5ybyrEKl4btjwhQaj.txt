After Forbes contributor Gene Marks wrote a column entitled, " If I were a poor black kid ," writer and comedian Baratunde Thurston responded with " Letter from a poor black kid " on CNN's In America blog. Marks responded Thursday with a letter to Thurston. A follow-up by Marks will appear in Forbes on Monday.Hi Baratunde,Thanks for your piece - I thought it raised great points and continued the discussion. I wish you success with your new book too. And I read The Onion every day.What do I know about being a "poor black kid?" Absolutely nothing. I'm a middle class white guy. But I went to school. So I know about that. And I'm in the business of technology. So I know about that.How can any inner city kid even have the chance to overcome the inequality that our President spoke about and have a chance at some opportunity?1. Study hard and get good grades.2. Use technology to help you get good grades.3. Apply to the best schools you can.4. Get help from a school's guidance counselor.5. Learn a good skill. This is what I said in my blog. I said this wasn't easy. It's brutally hard. And, unfortunately, it's not funny.Will any of these kids read what I wrote in Forbes ? Probably not. I'm hoping that educators, bloggers and most importantly parents do. Because it will be very tough for any kid to do it alone.Regards,Gene Marks
