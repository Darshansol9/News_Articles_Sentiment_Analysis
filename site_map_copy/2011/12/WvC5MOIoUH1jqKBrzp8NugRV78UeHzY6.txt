(CNN) -- Lowe's has pulled its advertising from the reality TV show "All-American Muslim," which the retail store called a "lightning rod.""All-American Muslim" is an eight-part series that follows five Muslim families living in Dearborn, Michigan."Lowe's has received a significant amount of communication on this program, from every perspective possible. Individuals and groups have strong political and societal views on this topic, and this program became a lightning rod for many of those views. As a result we did pull our advertising on this program," the company said in a statement Saturday."We believe it is best to respectfully defer to communities, individuals and groups to discuss and consider such issues of importance."
