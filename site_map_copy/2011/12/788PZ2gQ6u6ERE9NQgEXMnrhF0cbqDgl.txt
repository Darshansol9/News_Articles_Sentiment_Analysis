By Sally Holland, CNNWashington (CNN) â€“ Math scores in some urban school districts are improving faster than the nation as a whole according to a report released Wednesday by the National Assessment Governing Board that compares math and reading scores for fourth and eighth graders."We continue to narrow the differences between urban school districts and the nation at large," said Michael Casserly of the Council of the Great City Schools.Large city school districts tend to have higher numbers of students considered to be at risk than their suburban counterparts because the students often come from lower-income households or are from black or Hispanic families, groups that traditionally score lower than whites on standardized tests."Despite their distinct challenges, many of these districts are making steady progress in math. But, like school districts nationwide, they need to find ways to raise student achievement in reading," said David Driscoll of the National Assessment Governing Board. Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Baltimore and Philadelphia improved their scores in grade four mathematics, while Atlanta; Charlotte, North Carolina; Chicago; Detroit; the District of Columbia and Jefferson County, Kentucky, improved their grade eight mathematics scores when compared to the last assessment two years ago. Charlotte also had an increase in its eighth grade reading scores compared to the 2009 assessment.Read More
