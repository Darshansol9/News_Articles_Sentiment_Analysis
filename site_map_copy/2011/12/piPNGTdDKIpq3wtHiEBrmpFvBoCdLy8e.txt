By Thelma Gutierrez and Traci Tamura, CNNEvery Sunday, in an unmarked building, in an undisclosed location in the college town of Athens, Georgia, a group of students quietly gather in secret. They are aspiring professors, diplomats and engineers who have been banned from Georgia's top five public universities.But here, in this donated space, it is safe to study.This place is called Freedom University. It has one classroom and four professors, scholars who've taught at the likes of Amherst, Harvard, Emory and Yale, who are teaching here, on their days off, without pay.Their students are undocumented. They have nowhere else to go and no one else to teach them.
