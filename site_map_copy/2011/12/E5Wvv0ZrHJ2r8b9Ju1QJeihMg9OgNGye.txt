Republican presidential hopeful Herman Cain announced this weekend that he suspended his campaign. Support had waned in recent weeks after allegations of sexual harassment and a woman claimed they had a 13-year affair. He didn't officially drop out of the race, but said he suspended the campaign after assessing the impact the sex allegations had on his family and supporters.
