The hotline number is 855-448-6903.A new "detainer" form -- which includes Spanish, French, Portuguese, Chinese and Vietnamese translations -- also is part of the new policy. The detainer -- or notice to detain -- form is official paperwork giving law enforcement the authority to hold a person in custody for a time.JUST WATCHED Is the GOP shifting on immigration?

One of these citizens was held for two days because of an immigration detainer despite repeatedly telling officers that he was a U.S. citizen," Laura Vazquez, immigration legislative analyst for the National Council of La Raza, told CNN in a statement. The council is a national Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization.CNN attempted to get reaction on the new policy from the attorneys general in Alabama and Arizona -- two states viewed as having among the most strict immigration reform laws -- but were unsuccessful. An official in the Alabama attorney general's office said Thursday officials had no comment.The move by DHS comes just before the beginning of the new year, when new immigration laws in Louisiana, Tennessee, South Carolina and Georgia will require businesses to enroll in the federal E-Verify program to ensure employees are eligible to work in the United States, according National Conference of State Legislatures.E-Verify is a controversial program designed to check a prospective employee's citizenship or immigration status.Supporters say it helps businesses avoid unintentionally hiring illegal immigrants. Critics complain that it is expensive to operate, pushes undocumented workers further underground, and is not always accurate.
