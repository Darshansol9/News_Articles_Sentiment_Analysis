"The Mountaintop," a Broadway play by Katori Hall, considers the last day of Martin Luther King Jr.'s life -- April 3,1968. But Hall had never set foot inside his room at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, where King was killed until she stepped in with CNN's Soledad O'Brien. The hotel room where King stayed was maintained as a shrine to the civil rights leader.
