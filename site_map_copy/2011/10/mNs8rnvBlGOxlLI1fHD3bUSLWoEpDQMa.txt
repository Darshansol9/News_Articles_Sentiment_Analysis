"It's hard to climb around in there, to walk around in there, even from the air to see something from there; it's not surprising to me that we didn't find him on those first searches."Police are awaiting further autopsy results. "Throughout the investigation, we have found no signs of foul play," Navarre said.An acquaintance who helped in the search told CNN in July that Brown left behind cash, a passport and his driver's license. Brown disappeared June 29 in the vicinity of Skydive Moab, northwest of the town, said owner Clint MacBeth. MacBeth found Brown's personal items, including an unspent paycheck.Brown's family in Halifax, Nova Scotia, filed a missing person report after he disappeared.According to MacBeth, friends initially assumed Brown had gone to Las Vegas to visit his girlfriend. But they later realized he wore only shorts, a T-shirt and sneakers, making him unequipped to deal with 100-degree-plus temperatures, MacBeth said.Moab is known for its red-rock landscapes and proximity to Arches National Park and Canyonlands National Park.
