I agree. But that important message is being drowned out by a heated online debate.In July, I interviewed Arrington for my upcoming documentary, "Black in America: The New Promised Land: Silicon Valley ," which chronicles the journey of eight African-American tech entrepreneurs trying to succeed in Silicon Valley.Arrington founded the influential blog TechCrunch, which since 2005 has covered the tech startup environment. He's also a venture capitalist, helping fund tech entrepreneurs. And he has written previously that he believes Silicon Valley is a meritocracy.Last week, we held three advance screenings of portions of the documentary.
