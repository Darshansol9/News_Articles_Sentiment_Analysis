By Alene Dawson, Special to CNN(CNN) -- A generation once labeled "slackers," detached and melancholic has grown up to find out that reality doesn't bite as much it seemed when they were younger.To the contrary, most of the 84 million Americans ages 30 to 50 are "active, balanced and happy," according to the authors of " The Generation X Report ," a research report from the University of Michigan's Longitudinal Study of American YouthThe release is the first in a series of quarterly reports based on questionnaires, interviews and tests from 4,000 Gen X respondents who have participated in the study since 1987. The study defines Gen X as those born between 1961 and 1981, though others sources tag Gen X as those born starting in 1964.
