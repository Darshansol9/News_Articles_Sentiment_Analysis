He was arrested without incident after police pulled the vehicle over, said Officer Art Athans. It was unknown if any charges had been filed.The man was not carrying identification, Athans said. It was unclear if police found any weapons or other evidence in the car.Athans said investigators from San Diego were driving to Los Angeles to interview the man, whom he declined to call a suspect in the shootings. He instead used the term "person of interest."Police said Monday that a man was seen firing a gun at people while driving on Interstate 805 in a car that matched the Malibu's description. A 26-year-old man suffered non-life-threatening injuries, according to Maurice Luque, a spokesman for San Diego Fire-Rescue.The gunman is also suspected of shooting at another person, striking a vehicle, and firing at an ambulance on Interstate 5. A California Highway patrolman also may have been targeted while performing a stop on the right shoulder of I-805, Luque said.The car may also have been involved in a hit-and-run shortly before the shootings began. In that incident, a vehicle with a similar description struck a gate, and the driver fled the scene. No injuries were reported.
