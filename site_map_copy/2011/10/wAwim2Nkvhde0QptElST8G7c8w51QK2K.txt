"All involve commercial vehicles and passenger cars. There is one confirmed fatality and two additional victims with life-threatening injuries."Graves said 16 vehicles were involved in the chain reaction accidents at Pichacho Peak."We closed the eastbound lanes to allow emergency responders access to the scene," he said. "Due to the poor visibility, all patients were transported by ground ambulance to Tucson area hospitals."JUST WATCHED Dust storm causes multiple accidents Replay More Videos ...
