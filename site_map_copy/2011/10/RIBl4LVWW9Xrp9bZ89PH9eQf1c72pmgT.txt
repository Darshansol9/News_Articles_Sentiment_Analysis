Halloween is coming and students at Ohio University are speaking up against costumes that stereotype different races and ethnicities. The campaign, launched by the universityâ€™s Students Teaching Against Racism in Society, shows several young men and women holding posters of people in costumes -- an Arab suicide bomber, a Latino with an oversized sombrero and stuffed donkey, a Japanese geisha.The posters' headline: "We're a culture, not a costume.""The best way to get rid of stereotypes and racism is to have a discussion and raise awareness, which is what we want to do with this campaign," Sarah Williams, president of the student organization told CNN.
