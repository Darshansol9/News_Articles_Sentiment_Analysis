Story highlights Amid labor dispute, all 114 games canceledNBA lockout has now stretched to three monthsNo significant progress made in talksThe NBA on Tuesday canceled all its 114 preseason games, saying that no new collective bargaining agreement had been reached with players.The sometimes bitter NBA labor struggle and lockout has now stretched to three months."We can only say we are running out of time so many times," NBA Deputy Commissioner Adam Silver said Monday."We are aware of the calendar," NBA Players Association President Derek Fisher said on Monday. "We know our backs are against the wall in terms of regular season games and what those consequences will be."Last week, the NBA announced that it had postponed player training camps for the upcoming season and canceled all preseason games from October 9 to October 15.Training camps were scheduled to open on October 3.Representatives from both sides have been meeting, but no significant progress has been announced.The NBA began a lockout of its players in early July.NBA Commissioner David Stern has said that last season was not profitable for most of the league's 30 owners, who want cost-cutting help from players.The league lost as much as $300 million in the 2010-11 season, Stern has said.One of the battles has focused on the owners' rejection of the players union's call for an average $7 million player salary in the sixth year of a new labor deal.The current salary average is about $5 million.Other big issues include a fight over whether the NBA will strengthen its salary cap and a move by owners to get a bigger share of revenues.The last work stoppage occurred in 1998.
