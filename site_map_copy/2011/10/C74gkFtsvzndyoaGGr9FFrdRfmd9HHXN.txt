Story highlights The National Park Service blames wind gusts for the delayHigh winds blew one rapelling worker 30 feet away from the monument on FridaySpecialists are inspecting every inch of the monument for earthquake damageAssessment of the earthquake-damaged Washington Monument is expected to begin anew Monday.Authorities halted inspections Friday after wind gusts blew one of the roped-in workers off the monument, and moved him 30 feet away."Safety is always our first concern," Bob Vogel, superintendent of the National Mall and Memorial Parks, said in a statement Sunday. "And we had anticipated that there might be some weather delays."In an earlier statement, the National Park Police said as the engineering team was finishing Friday, climber Erik Sohn, who works for the Difficult Access Team from Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates (WJE), was lifted by the wind and pushed from the west face of the monument over to the south face."This is not unusual in these kinds of operations," Dan Lemieux, project manager from WJE, said in a statement. "Our guys are trained to deal with this kind of event. Erik's fine, and I think he even kind of enjoyed the ride."JUST WATCHED Scaling down the Washington monument Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Scaling down the Washington monument 01:04The team is assessing the exterior of the monument following damage from an 5.8 magnitude earthquake that shook much of the East Coast on August 23."The heaviest damage appears to be concentrated at the very top of the monument, in what is called the pyramidion, where large cracks of up to 1 1/4 inch wide developed through stone and mortar joints," Vogel said. Rainwater has leaked into the monument through the cracks and that could cause further damage.The Park Service said an interior assessment of the monument found it to be structurally sound and there is no danger of collapse.The Difficult Access Team has mainly focused on the top of the monument but will eventually rappel down the sides for a full inspection. The Park Service officials say they hope the assessment is completed by October 14, at which point they will have a better idea when the monument can be reopened to the public.
