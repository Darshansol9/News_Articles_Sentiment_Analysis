Police stood guard at the entrance of Washington Square Park, sending protesters spilling out into nearby streets.They chanted anti-Wall Street slogans and banged drums as they wandered into the night.The arrests came hours after thousands marched to New York's iconic Times Square on Saturday night, hoisting signs and chanting. Browne described the Times Square rally as orderly.As police cleared the street, protesters chanted, "We are peaceful" and "The whole world is watching."In another part of the city, another group of protesters made their voices heard."Banks got bailed out, we got sold out," chanted a crowd meandering east of the city's Zuccotti Park, considered a home base for the Manhattan protesters.Columns of police on patrol and atop scooters monitored the march, but as dusk fell, it appeared largely peaceful.In addition to the nationwide rallies, demonstrations have picked up steam, culminating in a global day of protests Saturday in Europe, Asia and Australia.The Occupy Wall Street movement started last month as a backlash against the economy and what demonstrators say is an out-of-touch corporate, financial and political elite.Organizers say they are inspired by the Arab Spring that led to the toppling of regimes in Tunisia and Egypt.The founding movement in the United States has spread to other major cities in the nation.
