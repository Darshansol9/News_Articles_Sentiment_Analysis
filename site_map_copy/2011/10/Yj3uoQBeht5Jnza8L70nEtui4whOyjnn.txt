Knox could not be reached for comment.The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey issued a statement saying it supports Knox's First Amendment right to post personal comments, even though it disagrees with the sentiments she allegedly expressed.The controversy comes on the heels of recent anti-bullying legislation in New Jersey following the high-profile suicide of a Rutgers University student, whose sexual encounter with another man was broadcast online without their knowledge.
