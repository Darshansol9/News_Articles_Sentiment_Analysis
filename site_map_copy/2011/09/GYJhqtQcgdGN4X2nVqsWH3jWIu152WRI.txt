Story highlights Five people remain hospitalized, four in serious conditionIdentities of seven of the dead are releasedThe downed plane had video and data recording devices, an NTSB official saysIt's unclear why the aircraft crashed, investigators have saidAn 11th person has died because of injuries sustained in the crash Friday at an air race at Reno, Nevada, an official with the Washoe County Medical Examiner's Office said Tuesday.No details about this latest victim were released. The official, Michelle Anderson, said there would be a news conference revealing more information late Tuesday.Authorities have so far identified seven people who died from the crash.The list includes the pilot, 74-year-old Jimmy Leeward, who lost control of his vintage plane before it plummeted into a crowd of spectators.He and six others were killed on the tarmac, while four have now died at hospitals.The six others identified are Joseph Wogan, 22, of Arizona; George and Wendy Hewitt of Washington state; Regina Bynum, 53, of Texas; Sharon Stewart, 47, of Nevada; and Gregory Morcom, 47, from Washington state.Almost 70 people were injured in the crash. Five patients remained hospitalized Tuesday at Saint Mary's Regional Medical Center, four in serious condition and one in fair condition, the hospital said in a statement.Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board announced Sunday that the World War II-era plane was equipped with data and video recording devices that they hope to use to help determine what happened and why.NTSB member Mark Rosekind described the devices, as well as the discovery of information and pieces that may have come from the devices, as "significant new information." It was also not entirely expected, given the relatively small size and nature of the P-51 aircraft."I'm not aware of a lot of aircraft having it; this is the first one I came across," said Howard Plagens, the NTSB official heading the investigation.Plagens was referring to a "box" that recorded key variables such as altitude, latitude and oil pressure. In addition, there was an outward-facing video camera on the plane, according to Rosekind.Several memory cards have been found at the wreckage site that may have come from either device and will be sent to the NTSB laboratory in Washington for a full analysis, Rosekind said. They may belong to some of the 200,000 spectators who were at the annual National Championship Air Races and Air Show.JUST WATCHED Reno Air Show victims remembered Replay More Videos ...

Countering earlier reports, Rosekind said Sunday that Leeward did not send a "Mayday call," indicating he was in distress.Investigators have repeatedly stated that it is not known why the aircraft nosedived. Some speculation has surrounded the elevator trim tab, which was breaking apart prior to the crash, a photograph shows.Investigators also will pore over "a tremendous (amount of) video that was captured" at the scene, according to Rosekind.A preliminary report will be available Friday, but Rosekind has said the full investigation could take six to nine months."It's not just what happened, it's why it happened," he said Sunday. "(We're) trying to make sure this doesn't happen again."
