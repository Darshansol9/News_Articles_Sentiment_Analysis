He said he travels by car regularly to the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn for visits with his grandparents, but he has been forced to curtail those visits due to the toll increases."I used to be able afford the tolls when they were only $6, but it became difficult when they raised them to $8," Weisshaus said.Weisshaus said he started driving through the toll plazas without paying, explaining to the attendants that he couldn't afford the tolls anymore. He said he has received up to 15 fines mailed to him by the agency for unpaid tolls, and his suit seeks relief from those fines as well."I'm looking to stop the abuse," he said.Weisshaus said the tolls were increased unfairly without proper public hearings where commuters like him could challenge the increases.In addition, he accuses the Port Authority of overstepping its authority by enacting increases without tabling them for votes in the state legislatures in both New York and New Jersey.And, in a swipe at the Port Authority's multibillion dollar construction project at the World Trade Center site in Lower Manhattan, Weisshaus' complaint reads, "There is no other relief but for the court to declare that the revenues of toll cannot and shall not be used for any use other than maintenance and building of the current and future bridges and tunnels."The site was the target of terrorist attacks in 2001 that killed thousands. The Port Authority owns the site and is spearheading its redevelopment."I didn't destroy the World Trade Center; I shouldn't have to pay for it." Weisshaus said. "I see it as a private real estate development, so why should commuters have to pay for it."Weisshaus said he is getting lots of encouragement from his grandparents. He said his grandmother is Gizella Weisshaus, the lead plaintiff in a 1996 court case filed against Swiss banks over assets held by European Jews who perished during the Holocaust."She's a fighter," Weisshaus said of his grandmother. "She tells me you should never give up your rights.""I can only represent myself," he said. "Yes, my plight is shared with a lot of other people; maybe others should go out and file their own suits."
