I cannot explain the feeling when they told me about my selection. Euphoria hit me smack-dead in the head!I was elated and felt so honored.

Thank you all so much!CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean to Kids Off the Block?Latiker: This honor validates that organizations such as ours are needed and appreciated. I hope being a Top 10 CNN Hero will give us the platform to further our mission of saving youth.Our community is plagued by violence, hopelessness and negativity. CNN has replaced all that with hope.

Deciding eight years ago to open my life to others has enriched not only my life, but the lives of hundreds of young people. This proves to me that giving hope to others is the key to changing lives. For that I am grateful.I know I'm only one person, but I believe in the power of one. I really do. I believe that I can do things and I can change people. And it's been working. If I can make a change in a generation, then my community's going to get better -- because they're going to be the ones that take it over.
