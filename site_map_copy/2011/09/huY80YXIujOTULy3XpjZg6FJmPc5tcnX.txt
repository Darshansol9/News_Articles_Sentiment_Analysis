Story highlights After death of killer whale trainer, OSHA said SeaWorld didn't take proper precautionsDawn Brancheau died during 2010 Florida showSeaWorld says "allegations are completely baseless"It's unclear whether video of Brancheau's death will be shown at this week's hearingA federal hearing began Monday to determine whether SeaWorld Orlando should be charged with a willful violation in the 2010 death of killer whale trainer Dawn Brancheau.As witnesses took the stand inside the Seminole County Courthouse in Sanford, Florida, members of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, demonstrated outside. Monday was the first day of the hearing, which will resume at 9 a.m. Tuesday and is expected to continue all week.In February 2010, as park guests watched in horror, Brancheau, 40, was pulled into a SeaWorld pool and drowned by a 12,000-pound killer whale named Tilikum. Brancheau had been sitting on the Shamu Stadium's pool edge during a private show.After a lengthy investigation, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration -- the federal agency that works to prevent workplace injuries -- cited SeaWorld of Florida in August 2010 for willfully endangering employees by not taking proper safety precautions."SeaWorld recognized the inherent risk of allowing trainers to interact with potentially dangerous animals," Cindy Coe, OSHA's Atlanta regional administrator, said in a statement.JUST WATCHED Is whale to blame for trainer's death?

Black called the document a release waiver and argued that the park's training for the handlers was not enough.SeaWorld's attorney said the handlers' training is only one component, noting that the animals are trained, too."It goes hand in hand," said Carla J. Gunnin Stone.It's unclear if OSHA's attorneys will present surveillance video showing Brancheau's death. Her relatives have fought to keep it sealed.U.S. District Judge Gregory Presnell on Thursday denied the Brancheau family's request to keep the tape from being released or used at the hearing."We cannot comment on what may or may not be presented (during the hearing), as that depends not only on our own attorneys but also on any rulings issued by the judge in the case," OSHA spokesman Michael Wald said.Since the accident, SeaWorld has restricted all trainers from entering the water with killer whales until further notice, though Tilikum has returned in a theme park show called "One Ocean."
