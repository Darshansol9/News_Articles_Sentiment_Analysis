(CNN) Illinois' Medicaid program will soon ensure coverage of gender-affirming surgeries for transgender adults who meet certain diagnostic criteria, the state's Department of Healthcare and Family Services said in a release.The department is developing rules for the coverage, and it's likely to be adopted this summer, according to the release.Medicaid members must be at least 21 years old and have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, a term that describes the distress people suffer when the gender they identify with doesn't match the gender assigned to them at birth."For those facing gender dysphoria, every day can be a painful challenge, Theresa Eagleson, HFS director, said in the statement.
