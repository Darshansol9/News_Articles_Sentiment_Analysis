(CNN) The brothers accused of attacking actor Jussie Smollett, only to be cleared when prosecutors announced Smollett had orchestrated a hoax to advance his career, are suing his legal team for defamation, attorneys said Tuesday.The federal lawsuit alleges defamation and false light by attorney Tina Glandian for saying, among other things, that brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo attacked the "Empire" actor and dealt steroids, and "inferring" that Abimbola engaged in sexual relations with the actor."In short, Mr. Smollett used his clout as a wealthy actor to influence Plaintiffs, who were in a subordinate relationship to him and were aspiring to 'make it' in Hollywood," said the lawsuit filed in US District Court in Chicago.
