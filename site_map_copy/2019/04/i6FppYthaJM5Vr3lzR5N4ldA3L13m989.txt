(CNN) An attorney for Dallas Mavericks forward Kristaps Porzingis said Monday that a woman accusing him of rape is lying in an attempt to extort the Latvian basketball star.ESPN and the New York Post have reported details of the accusations, which stem from an alleged incident last year and were reported to police last week, but CNN has not been able to confirm the majority of the reports.Porzingis' attorney, though, lambasted the Post's report, and said if the New York Police Department leaked information to the newspaper without first conducting an investigation, it would be "a shame.""It was utterly irresponsible for the New York Post to publish a story that was a result of an irresponsible leak by the police," lawyer Roland Riopelle told CNN."It was terribly irresponsible of the police department to make statements about a situation that was referred to federal authorities regarding extortion.
