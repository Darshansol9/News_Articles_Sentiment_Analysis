(CNN) Minnesotans expecting a fresh layer of white stuff following Thursday's unseasonable blizzard instead found snow with a brown-orange tinge, just like the dusty expanse of West Texas.It was no coincidence.The major spring storm that delivered blizzard conditions from the Dakotas to Minnesota was so big and strong that it also hurled dirt from New Mexico and Texas into the atmosphere, where winds kept it aloft for more than 900 miles. It eventually fell back to the ground in Minnesota, where it mixed with snow upon descent.Social media unofficially christened the mixture "snirt," a combination of "snow" and "dirt."A satellite image taken Thursday shows the West Texas dust being blown northeast, the National Weather Service Twin Cities tweeted.
