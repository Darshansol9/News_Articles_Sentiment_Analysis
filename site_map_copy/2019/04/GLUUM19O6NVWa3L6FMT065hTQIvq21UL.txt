(CNN) A woman walked out of Payless with hundreds of new shoes, but none of them are for her.Addy Tritt saw that all pairs of shoes were on sale for $1 at her local Payless in Hays, Kansas, last week, and something told her to go.The retail value of the shoes was around $6,000, Tritt said. She said she negotiated for 2.5 hours until she could get all of the shoes in the store -- 204 pairs -- for pennies each, and only paid $100 for the bill.The store needed to sell the shoes anyway. Payless announced in February that it was closing all its stores across the United States and started liquidation sales.Tritt donated all of the shoes to Nebraska flood victims. "I'm Catholic and I believe that it's just part of God's plan for me to help people," the 25-year-old graduate teaching assistant told CNN. "Whether it's volunteering in a classroom or donating, that's what I'm going to do."Read More
