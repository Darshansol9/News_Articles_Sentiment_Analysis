(CNN) The man accused of carrying out a killing spree at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, has pleaded not guilty and says he was suffering a mental disorder at the time of last year's killings, according to court documents.The plea, filed Monday in Anne Arundel County Circuit Court, comes 10 months after the shootings that left five people dead.Jarrod Ramos, the plea says, is not criminally responsible "because, at the time of the conduct alleged in the above captioned case, the Defendant, because of a mental disorder, lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct, and/or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law."Jarrod Ramos is accused of killing five Capital Gazette employees in June.The two-page filing did not elaborate, but it says that the plea stands for all 23 counts on which Ramos was indicted in July.State law defines a mental disorder as "a behavioral or emotional illness that results from a psychiatric or neurological disorder."Read More
