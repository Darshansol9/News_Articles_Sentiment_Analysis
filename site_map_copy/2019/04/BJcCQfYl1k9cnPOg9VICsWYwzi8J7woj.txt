(CNN) A judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked the release of video that allegedly shows New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft receiving sexual services at a Florida day spa, Palm Beach State Attorney's Office spokesman Mike Edmondson told CNN.An April 29 hearing is scheduled before Circuit Judge Joseph Marx, who issued the temporary protective order, according to Edmondson.
