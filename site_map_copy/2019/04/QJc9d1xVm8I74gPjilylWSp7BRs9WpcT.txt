(CNN) Actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, are "not ready" to enter a plea for their alleged role in the college admissions scandal, a source close to the actress said."They are not ready to make a plea like Felicity (Huffman) and go down that road. They are hoping to just let this play out in the judicial system. They are innocent until proven guilty," a source close to Loughlin told CNN."They wish the media would just leave them alone. They feel like there is no story and don't understand why the press keep hounding them and following Lori to yoga."The couple appeared last week in federal court in Boston but have not publicly indicated how they plan to plead. Actress Felicity Huffman and others have agreed to plead guilty in the case.Loughlin and Giannulli are accused of paying $500,000 to a fake charity to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as crew recruits, even though the daughters did not participate in the sport.Read More
