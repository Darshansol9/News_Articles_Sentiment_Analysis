(CNN) While beautiful spring temperatures have settled into the Plains and Midwest, folks there shouldn't get used to it. There's a storm on the way that's going to remind Midwesterners that winter's never over till it's over.The potential is there for a " bomb cyclone " to impact the Plains this week. That's an area of low pressure that drops 24 millibars in 24 hours -- aka a potent, rapidly intensifying storm system.This would be the second time in less than a month a storm of this magnitude has developed in the Plains. It's rare enough to have one form inland, much less two.Typically we see "bomb cyclones" form off the US East Coast in the form of nor'easters.Right now the forecast models have the storm teetering on the edge of bomb-cyclone criteria.
