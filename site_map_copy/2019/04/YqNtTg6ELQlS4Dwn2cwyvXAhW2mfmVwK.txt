(CNN) For the second time in four months, South Carolina teachers are fed up and ready to rally.Hundreds of educators plan to protest at the state capitol on May 1 at an event called "#AllOutMay1.""Those that care about public education in South Carolina demand better teacher pay, smaller class size, removing other duties as assigned from teacher contracts, less testing and a pledge from our legislature that they will say no to for-profit charter schools and educational savings accounts," the SC for Ed advocacy group saidfor the protest. It's not clear how many schools, if any, will be forced to close next Wednesday. As of Tuesday afternoon, 355 people had registered on Facebook"We know it is a sacrifice for educators to be out of their classrooms," SC for Ed said. "However, not participating in this event will only allow the cycle of detrimental education policy to continue in our state."
