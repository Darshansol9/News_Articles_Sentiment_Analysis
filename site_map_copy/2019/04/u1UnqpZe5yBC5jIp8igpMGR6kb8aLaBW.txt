(CNN) USA Gymnastics' revolving door of presidents has produced sweeping promises to recover from the Larry Nassar abuse scandal.But all four leaders in the past two years have faced widespread criticism over gaffes deemed insensitive to Nassar's survivors.The latest example: Newly minted USAG President Li Li Leung told NBC's "Today" show that she, too, was examined by the disgraced doctor when she was a gymnast.The controversial comment came when Leung explained why she wasn't abused by the former USAG team doctor."The reason why I wasn't abused by him is because my coach was by my side when he saw me. I was seen by him in a public setting," Leung said in an interview that aired Wednesday.
