(CNN) A Florida judge did not rule Friday on whether surveillance video will be released in the Robert Kraft prostitution sting case.Instead, Judge Leonard Hanser asked all parties to submit proposed orders in the case by Tuesday. The sting resulted in misdemeanor charges against Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots.Friday's hearing at the Palm Beach County Courthouse took place after media outlets, including CNN, requested that video from the sting be released. The video allegedly shows Kraft receiving paid sexual services at a Florida day spa in JanuaryKraft is accused of having solicited prostitution at a Florida day spa.But Kraft's legal team said the video was "basically pornography" and is asking a judge to prevent the videos' release to the news media, in part because the footage's release would violate Kraft's right to privacy.The defense also argued that the court should prevent the videos' public release at least until it rules on Kraft's argument that the footage was illegally obtained and therefore should be kept from trial. That ruling is expected later this month.
