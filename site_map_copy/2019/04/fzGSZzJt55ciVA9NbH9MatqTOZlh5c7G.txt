(CNN) Jersey City may soon become the first city in New Jersey to mandate rideshare vehicles have illuminated, identifiable signs for passengers, according to a news release from the mayor's office.Mayor Steven Fulop announced a proposed ordinance Friday, according to the release. The ordinance comes after the death of University of South Carolina student and New Jersey native Samantha Josephson , who was kidnapped and killed when she mistakenly got into a vehicle she thought was her Uber ride.The purpose of the ordinance is to alert riders and prevent another incident like Josephson's murder, the release said. The ordinance will be introduced at the April 10 Jersey City Council Meeting."These unfortunate tragedies bring to light the work that can be done on an administrative level to help keep people safe," Fulop said. "I encourage all rideshare users to verify the driver they requested by looking for these signs, and to ensure extra precaution, ask the driver to identify themselves using a name or a pin number."According to New Jersey's Transportation Network Company Safety and Regulatory Act, all companies must create and issue identifying markers -- such as logos or emblems -- to drivers to display in their vehicles. Many rideshare vehicles do display company stickers or signs in their windows.Read More
