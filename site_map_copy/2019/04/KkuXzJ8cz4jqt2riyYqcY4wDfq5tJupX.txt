Nelson said in a statement. "Obsolete systems within the building will be replaced. Safety and seismic concerns will be addressed. Accessibility will be enhanced so that members with limited mobility can be better accommodated."The temple is expected to reopen by 2024 with a public open house, officials said.Only church members in good standing are allowed inside the temple.
