(CNN) A bill that would ban schools and workplaces from having dress codes that forbid braids, twists and other natural hair styles has passed the California State Senate.SB 188 updates the state's anti-discrimination laws so the definition of race "also include traits historically associated with race, including, but not limited to, hair texture and protective hairstyles."It passed on Monday in a 37-0 vote and will now go to the State Assembly.The bill, which is also known as the C.R.O.W.N. Act (Create a Respectful and Open Workplace for Natural Hair), states that the standards of professional dress and grooming in workplaces and schools are often based on Eurocentric standards."Workplace dress code and grooming policies that prohibit natural hair, including afros, braids, twists, and locks, have a disparate impact on Black individuals as these policies are more likely to deter Black applicants and burden or punish Black employees than any other group," it said.
