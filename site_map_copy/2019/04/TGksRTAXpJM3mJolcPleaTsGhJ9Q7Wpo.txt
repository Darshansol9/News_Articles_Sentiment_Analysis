(CNN) Barnard College is investigating a confrontation between a black Columbia University student and the college's public safety officers after video of the incident showed officers pinning the student down once he refused to show them ID.The school is hiring an independent investigator to review the incident and issue a public report with recommendations, according to a statement released Sunday by Barnard President Sian Leah Beilock."The confrontation puts into stark relief what some members of the Barnard College community, particularly people of color, have been saying about their relationship with the Office of Public Safety and the lack of trust they have in it to keep them safe," Beilock said.
