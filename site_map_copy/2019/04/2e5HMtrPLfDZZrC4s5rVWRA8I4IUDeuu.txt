(CNN) The man arrested for allegedly pushing or throwing a boy from the third floor of the Mall of America in Minnesota had been banned from the mall in the past and once told police he had anger issues, court records show.Witnesses said Emmanuel Deshawn Aranda, 24, either pushed or threw the 5-year-old boy on Friday morning from the third level of the Bloomington mall's interior to the first-level floor nearly 40 feet below, police said.Aranda, whom police said took off running after the incident, was found inside the mall's transit station and arrested.Authorities described the boy's injuries as life-threatening and said witnesses gave him first aid.
