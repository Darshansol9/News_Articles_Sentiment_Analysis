(CNN) Illinois' child welfare authorities on Friday reassigned a caseworker and supervisor to "administrative duty" during a review of their interactions with the parents of a 5-year-old boy whose body was found wrapped in plastic in a shallow grave.The Department of Children and Family Services said it has launched "a comprehensive review of our work" with the family of Andrew "AJ" Freund , whose parents reported missing last week before providing information that ultimately led to the recovery of his body about 10 miles from their Crystal Lake home."Both the caseworker and the supervisor responsible for this case have been placed on administrative duty and will have no casework responsibilities as this review takes place," DCFS said in a four-page summary detailing the agency's contact with the family back to 2012."DCFS will also be reviewing all cases that have been handled by these two employees."The parents, Andrew Freund Sr. and JoAnn Cunningham, face charges of first-degree murder, aggravated battery and aggravated domestic battery and failure to report a missing or child death, police said. Freund Sr. also faces charges of concealment of homicidal death.Read More
