New York (CNN) For years, authorities say, a man lured women with drug addictions into a sex trafficking ring he ran out of his parents' Long Island basement, allegedly keeping them locked up and forcing them to perform sex acts with others in exchange for money and drugs.That man, Raymond Rodio III, 47, was indicted by a grand jury on April 17 on eight counts of sex trafficking and six counts of promoting prostitution. He was arraigned Thursday, pleaded not guilty and is being held on $1 million cash bail, according to Suffolk County District Attorney Tim Sini.The Legal Aid Society of Suffolk County, which is representing Rodio, had no comment when contacted by CNN. Rodio faces a maximum of 25 years in prison if he is convicted.Rodio mainly targeted vulnerable women in their 20s who were addicted to drugs, Sini said. The ring allegedly ran between December 2014 and February 2019, and Sini said about 20 women were victims.Sini said Rodio would initially provide the women with drugs like heroin and crack cocaine for free. "He would then hold their addictions, their diseases, over their heads to force them to work with him," Sini said. "He would initially supply many of these women with drugs for free so that they would develop a dependency on him. After he set up prostitution dates for his victims, he would provide them with heroin or crack cocaine in order to impair their judgment."Read More
