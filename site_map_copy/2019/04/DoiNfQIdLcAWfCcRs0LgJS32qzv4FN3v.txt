Opelousas, Louisiana (CNN) As arson investigators worked to find out who has been setting Louisiana churches ablaze, the Rev. Dwight Brown slept in his church two nights last week, he said Wednesday."I was afraid my church was going to be targeted. My church is directly between two of the churches," he said. "I wasn't going to sit there and let it burn down. It's 130 years of history.
