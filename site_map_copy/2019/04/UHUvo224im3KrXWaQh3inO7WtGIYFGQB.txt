The main line of storms will begin to push into this area late Sunday morning and trek to the east on Sunday afternoon. The center said it expects the threat of severe weather to increase throughout the afternoon."Damaging winds appear to be the greatest threat on Sunday, but tornadoes will also be possible," CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said.The risk will slowly diminish as the system begins to weaken Sunday evening.Sunday tee times moved up at The MastersGeorgia's Augusta National Golf Club is included in the slight risk area Sunday as the Masters golf tournament concludes. Tournament organizers have moved up tee times for Sunday because of the storm threat.The storms are expected to move through the Augusta area during the afternoon and evening.The tornado threat will be lower by then, but damaging winds could still present hazardous conditions.
