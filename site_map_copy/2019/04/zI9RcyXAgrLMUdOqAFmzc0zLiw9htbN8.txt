(CNN) Chicago's police union and a group of suburban police chiefs called for the resignation of Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx after holding votes of no confidence, they said in a press conference Thursday.The Chicago Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) and the police chiefs associations voted more than a week after Foxx's office dropped all charges against actor Jussie Smollett. FOP President Kevin Graham said the move undermined the public's faith in the criminal justice system.But, the leaders insisted, their issues with Foxx did not start with Smollett, who was accused of fabricating an possible hate crime against himself to bolster his profile and his career."This is not just about Jussie Smollett," Graham said. "This is about many cases in the Cook County system that have gone unprosecuted, or having charges reduced.""The people standing around me can give you countless examples of how Ms. Foxx's lack of prosecution has caused our members and police officers throughout this country an enormous amount of problems," he said, "not to mention that people in Cook County are depending on the prosecutor to put people in jail, to charge them accordingly."Read More
