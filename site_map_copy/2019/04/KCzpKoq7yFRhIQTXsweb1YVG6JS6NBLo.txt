(CNN) The Archdiocese of Los Angeles has agreed to pay an $8 million settlement to a girl who was 15 years old when a coach at her Catholic high school sexually abused her, her lawyers said in a statement.The abuse occurred despite the archdiocese receiving written complaints accusing the coach, Juan Ivan Barajas, of having inappropriate relationships with other students at the all-girls San Gabriel Mission High School, the lawyers said.Juan Ivan Barajas"The archdiocese had many opportunities to put an end to Barajas, yet each time its administrators gave him yet another chance, and Barajas took full advantage of that lack of oversight and abused this vulnerable girl," said one of the lawyers, Dave Ring. "The victim is a courageous young lady who suffered tremendously given all she had to endure."The archdiocese issued this statement: "The archdiocese recognizes that there was serious harm done to the life of the victim-survivor. We hope that the settlement will allow her to heal and move forward with her education and lifetime goals. The archdiocese apologizes for the impact that this caused in her life."The student was a freshman in 2016 when Barajas, who was the volleyball coach as well as athletic director, began grooming her, the lawsuit says.Read More
