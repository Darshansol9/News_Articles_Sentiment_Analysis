(CNN) Passengers on a Southwest Airlines flight grew alarmed when they mistakenly thought they were on a 737 MAX 8 aircraft.The Federal Aviation Administration grounded the popular aircraft in mid-March following two fatal crashes within six months of each other. In October, a Lion Air plane crashed killing all 189 people on board, and in March an Ethiopian Airlines flight went down killing all 157 people on board.But when some passengers looked at the safety cards in their seat pockets, they saw "737 MAX 8" printed on them and got worried.A few took to social media to ask Southwest to explain:@SouthwestAir my app says the 737 max 800 is still grounded but that's what my flight from cvg to bwi just was. pic.twitter.com/pgM9jhs9Iq — understandblue (@understandblue) April 7, 2019@SouthwestAir Hi, just wondering why I was on a 737 max 8 yesterday.

Flight was Dal-cmh 5449. — A Dog's Brunch (@ADogsBrunch) April 7, 2019Southwest calmly explained to each confused customer that both aircraft types are printed on the same card.Read More
