(CNN) Hurricane researchers at Colorado State University are predicting a slightly below-average hurricane season this year, with about 13 named storms and five hurricanes.The researchers with Colorado State's Tropical Meteorology Project predict that this hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30, will have two major hurricanes, which are defined as Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. A Category 3 storm has winds of 111 to 129 mph.Between 1981 and 2010, the Atlantic Ocean averaged 12.1 named storms, 6.4 hurricanes and 2.7 major hurricanes per season, according to the researchers.The slightly below-average forecast is likely to come as a relief after 2018's above-average hurricane season. Last year, Hurricane Florence made landfall in North Carolina as a Category 1 hurricane and caused extensive flooding across the region, and Hurricane Michael made landfall in the Florida Panhandle as a powerful Category 4 hurricane."The team predicts that 2019 hurricane activity will be about 75 percent of the average season," the researchers said. "By comparison, 2018's hurricane activity was about 120 percent of the average season."Read More
