(CNN) Thanks to the same DNA technology that caught the Golden State Killer suspect, authorities in Washington state arrested a 77-year-old man in the 1972 killing of 20-year-old Jody Loomis, the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office said."After more than 46 years of searching for her killer, we finally have some answers for Jody's family," said Sheriff Ty Trenary. "Thanks to the relentless persistence of our cold case team and new DNA technology, we are one step closer to justice for Jody."The case dates to August 1972, when Loomis, 20, left her home and rode her bicycle toward a stable to ride her horse. Her body was found disrobed and shot in the head in the woods, authorities said.The case was unsolved until the recent emergence of genetic genealogy , which is a combination of traditional DNA evidence with the type of genealogic analysis made famous by companies like 23andMe and Ancestry.Previously, DNA evidence from the crime scene could only be compared to a specific suspect or put into limited national databases to find direct matches.Read More
