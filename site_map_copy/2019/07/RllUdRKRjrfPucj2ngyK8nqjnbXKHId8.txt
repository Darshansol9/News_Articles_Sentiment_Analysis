(CNN) A former University of Southern California gynecologist, charged with sexually abusing his patients, also enticed young women into foreign hotel rooms where he made sex videos that he later sold, a Los Angeles prosecutor alleged Tuesday.George Tyndall "takes pictures, he takes videos, sex videos and then he sells them," said Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Reinhold Mueller, adding that if Tyndall could do that in a hotel room outside the United States, "he can certainly do it in his bedroom, in his residence, in LA."Mueller made the sex tape allegations in arguing that the defendant's bail, originally set at nearly $2.1 million, should not be lowered.In the end, Superior Court Judge Teresa Sullivan lowered Tyndall's bail to $1.6 million. She said Tyndall's lack of a prior record, in addition to no previous attempts to flee, influenced her decision. Should Tyndall post the bail, he will be on GPS house arrest and he will have to surrender any documents needed to travel, including a passport.Tyndall, 72, was fired in 2017 for inappropriate behavior by USC, which did not report him to law enforcement or state medical authorities. On June 26, Tyndall was arrested on sexual abuse charges for alleged assaults against 16 victims that occurred between 2009 and 2016 while he worked at the campus health center, authorities say.Read More
