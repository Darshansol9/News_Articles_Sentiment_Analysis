Emanuella GrinbergTamara Requeña, Juan Bautista and their friends came all the way from Spain for WorldPride.They said Madrid, where they live, has an amazing Pride celebration. But they came to New York to celebrate with the rest of the world, Requeña said."We're chasing the best Pride celebration," she said."We are the new generation of gay people in the world," Bautista added. "We have to celebrate."Their only critique was that Spain has more free Pride events, such as concerts and shows, unlike most of the Pride-related entertainment in New York. They also mentioned that the parade did not continue in a steady procession, with gaps between groups and floats approaching 10 to 15 minutes as the parade approached the six-hour mark.
