(CNN) Attorneys representing Marshae Jones, the pregnant woman indicted in the death of her unborn child after being shot in the abdomen, have filed a motion asking a judge to dismiss all charges against their client.Jones' attorneys say the charges are "completely unreasonable and unjust" and based on a "novel legal theory not available or supported under Alabama law," according to the motion filed in Alabama Circuit Court on Monday."Our client is a very fragile person who has been subjected to unmitigated abuse," Mark White, lead attorney for Jones, told CNN's Brianna Keilar on Monday. Two days after Jones was shot, law enforcement visited her in the hospital, spending no more than 15 minutes with her, White said."That is the last time anyone from law enforcement or anyone associated with prosecuting this case spoke to our client until last Wednesday, when they asked her to come to the police station," said White. She arrived with her 6-year-old daughter in tow, he said. "They put the cuffs on her, locked her up and set bond at 50,000 dollars."Last Thursday, a Jefferson County grand jury indicted Jones, 27, on a manslaughter charge, which is a Class B felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison.Read More
