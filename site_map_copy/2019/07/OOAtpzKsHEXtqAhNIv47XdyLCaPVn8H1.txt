White HousePresident Trump struck back at the UK diplomat who called him "inept" and "clumsy" in leaked diplomatic cables . Trump, through tweets of course, said his White House would no longer deal with British Ambassador to the US Kim Darroch. A spokesman for outgoing UK Prime Theresa May said she still has "full faith" in Darroch, but it's hard to see at this point how he can effectively do his job. Trump's tweets were more than just him lashing out at someone who ticked him off. The President, CNN's Stephen Collinson says, is trying to gain political leverage over the Brits and make it harder for another country to get "accurate diplomatic reporting and internal intelligence" on his administration.2.
