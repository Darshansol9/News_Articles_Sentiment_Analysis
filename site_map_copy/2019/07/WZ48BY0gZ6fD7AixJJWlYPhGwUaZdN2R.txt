(CNN) Cheyenne Hoyt recorded the moment an ICE agent smashed through a car window to arrest her boyfriend, Florencio Millan, who the government says was in the US illegally and wouldn't get out of the vehicle."He told my boyfriend to get out of the car or this could go bad," she said, adding that she had asked to see a warrant multiple times. "So once again, I asked for the warrant, he refused me again, I asked the name on the warrant and he refused."She said the agent told them he had a "paperless" warrant. After a couple of minutes, Hoyt said the Kansas City Police arrived."The police told us that they could either do this the easy way or the hard way," she said a day later, during a news conference Tuesday afternoon. "And all I said was 'all I want to see is a warrant or a name' and that's when they started to try to bust the window out of our car."ICE spokesman Shawn Neudauer said Millan was uncooperative and refused to step outside of his car, or "follow lawfully issued commands issued by ICE and local police."Read More
