(CNN) Holiday beachgoers in one Cape Cod town have a new emergency ally should the unthinkable happen: a "stop the bleed" first-aid kit for shark attack victims.The Orleans Fire Department in Massachusetts has placed the kits on some of its remote beaches to get life-saving equipment closer to potential victims.The first-aid kits are in waterproof and airtight cases.The kits contain, "bleeding control dressings, gloves and eye protection, and they are in a waterproof and airtight sealed case up the beach," Fire Chief Anthony Pike tells CNN.Eventually 10 kits will be deployed. These are in addition to those already available with lifeguards, EMTs on the beaches, and in fire department vehicles.Pike said the kits are great for doctors, nurses, and off-duty first responders. And directions are provided to help those who lack medical training.
