(CNN) A Roman Catholic diocese in Providence, Rhode Island, published a list of clergy members accused of sexually abusing minors.The list , published at the end of June, contains 50 names of deacons, clergy members and priests who have been accused, along with their ages and whether they resigned, died or were removed from the ministry.Some of the files that were used date to 1950, and every file was reviewed by the diocese's director of compliance.In a letter published Friday, Bishop of Providence Thomas Tobin outlined two reasons for publishing the list: a societal expectation and church members' right to know. He called the list an expression of transparency."The failure to publish the list would create an impression that we do not take the situation seriously, but we certainly do; or that we have something to hide, and in fact we do not!" Tobin wrote.
