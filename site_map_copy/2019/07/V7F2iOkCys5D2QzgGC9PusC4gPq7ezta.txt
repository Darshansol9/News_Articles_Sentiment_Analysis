(CNN) The ESPY Awards recognize excellence in sports, but this year's show also showcased moments of excellence in humanity.From overcoming tremendous obstacles, to creating environments for kids to find belonging, to turning tragedy into triumph, many of the honorees at Wednesday night's ESPY Awards brought as much heart as they did might.Here are some of the night's most inspirational moments.Coach Rob Mendez"When you dedicate yourself to something and open your mind to different possibilities ... you really can go places in this world." Rob Mendez's acceptance speech is everything. pic.twitter.com/32n7wP9BP3Rob Mendez said he never thought he would be sitting backstage with retired basketball superstar Dwyane Wade as he was at the award show.The head coach for the junior varsity football team at Prospect High School in California -- who was born without arms or legs and was never able to play the game himself -- recently brought his team to the league championship. On Wednesday, he was honored with the Jimmy V Perseverance Award.Mendez said onstage that he hopes his accomplishments serve to show others what is possible, even when presented with an obstacle that might seem insurmountable."When you dedicate yourself to something and open your mind to different possibilities and focus on what you can do instead of what you can't do, you really can go places in this world," he said.He said the game has given him so much, and the most rewarding part is seeing someone else's potential even before they do."You've got to be passionate, you've got to work at it, but it can happen," Mendez said. "And I'm not done yet. I've made it this far, and who says I can't go further?"Coach Jim Calhoun"We all have moments of quit in us. But I want to go out on my terms.

The young ones who need someone to be a pillar of hope, the men and women looking for some inspiration to keep going, and the nonbelievers waiting for me to prove them wrong," she said on Wednesday as she accepted her award."I am one of the lucky ones who came home.
