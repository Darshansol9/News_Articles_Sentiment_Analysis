(CNN) If you think a veggie burger sounds unappealing, wait until it's listed as a "vegetable-based protein" on a restaurant menu.That's how it could appear in Arkansas, the latest in a string of states to pass bills that control how so-called fake meat is marketed.The state's "truth in labeling" bill is set to take effect this week, banning the use of meat-related terminology to describe meatless products. The bill's authors say it's an effort to "protect consumers from being misled or confused."But veggie-meat maker Tofurky says it won't be silenced. On Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union said it had filed a free-speech lawsuit against the director of the Arkansas Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Standards on behalf of the vegetarian brand.The ACLU says that the state has violated the First Amendment, "censoring truthful speech in order to protect the economic interests of the meat industry."
