As a dangerous weather system spinning toward the Gulf coast intensified Thursday to become Tropical Storm Barry, some Louisiana residents aren't taking any chances and are choosing to evacuate. Others say they plan to ride the storm out.Heather Cafarella, 41, a bartender at R Bar, said people aren't panicked, but they are asking each other if they're going to evacuate."It's not just the hurricane. We flood when there's heavy rain. It doesn't take much, unfortunately," she said Thursday.Looking outside at the sunny street, Cafarella said, "The calm before the storm is so deceiving."Michael Nedelman/ CNNHerb James, 38, has lived in New Orleans since he was 11.He is renting a scooter, but it got stuck in a flood and isn't starting. James is worried about the storm and about having to pay the rental company for the damaged vehicle. He's crashing on friends' couches at the moment."If I have to evacuate, I don't have anywhere to evacuate to," James said.
