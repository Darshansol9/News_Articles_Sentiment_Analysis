In court today, Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman was smiling when he came in greeting his lawyers – first asking, “Y mi esposa?” (which means “And my wife?”).He then saw her at her usual seat in the second row on the right hand side of the court, blew her a kiss, and tapped his hand on his heart twice while looking at her.Emma Coronel Aispuro returned the kiss and blew it at him.Guzman’s voice quivered several times during his statement to the court.“First of all I want to thank my wife and my children for their unconditional love and support during this long proceeding,” Guzman said.When Guzman was thanking his wife, she could be seen leaning forward and bending her head down.On the way out of court after hearing his sentence, Guzman again blew his wife two kisses, which she returned in what could possibly be the moment of their final goodbye.When asked prior to sentencing if today is the last time Guzman will see his wife, defense attorney William Purpura said, “That's a good question. The way things stand right now, unfortunately, yes.”
