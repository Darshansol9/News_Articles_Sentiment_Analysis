(CNN) Rabbit rabbit! There, now you'll have a month of good luck .For some people, the most auspicious way to start a new month is by uttering those words. Others say "white rabbit," or repeat the word "rabbit" in some other quasi-ritualistic pattern, but the intent is always the same: To start the month on a good (rabbit's) foot.Where did this tradition come from?
