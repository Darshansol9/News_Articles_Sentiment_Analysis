Capital One hackThere's a huge data breach to tell you about this morning, and it might be one of the biggest. A hacker gained access this year to 100 million Capital One credit card accounts and applications . Paige Thompson was arrested yesterday and charged in connection with the hack, the Justice Department said. Thompson, 33, once worked as a software engineer for the cloud-hosting company that Capital One used. The personal information accessed -- which the feds say Thompson tried to share online -- included 140,000 Social Security numbers, 1 million Canadian Social Insurance numbers and 80,000 bank account numbers, as well as people's names, addresses, credit scores and other info. Capital One says it has fixed the problem, will notify those affected and will offer victims free credit monitoring.2. Gilroy festival shootingWe're learning more about the victims of the mass shooting at a popular food festival in Northern California. They were all so young. Trevor Irby, 25, had moved to California from New York to be with his fianc√©e, whom he was with at the Garlic Festival in Gilroy when he was shot and killed. Keyla Salazar was 13 and about to celebrate her birthday. She had spent the morning of the shooting cleaning and doing chores to convince her parents to buy her a puppy. The youngest victim was just 6. Stephen Romero was playing in a bounce house when he was hit by gunfire. His mom was shot in the hand and stomach.The shooter, who was killed by police about a minute after he opened fire, referenced a white supremacist text on social media. Investigators have also figured out that the AK-47-style rifle used in the attack was bought legally in Nevada, although it was illegal to take it to neighboring California.JUST WATCHED Police: Shooting suspect legally purchased rifle Replay More Videos ...

The officer, Mario Cerciello Rega, was stabbed 11 times with the knife, according to police. Two teenage American tourists have been arrested and charged in the slaying. Rega, 35, was killed late last week in Rome after returning to work after his honeymoon.

Philadelphia hospital closureDid a group of rich investors let a downtown Philadelphia hospital go bankrupt so they could profit from the land on which it sits ? That's the accusation being made against a private equity firm that bought Hahnemann University Hospital, which serves Philly's neediest residents. The equity firm, owned by Joel Freedman, bought the hospital early last year. But last week, it released its last patient, and within a month, all of the hospital's staff will have been laid off. City and state officials, unions and even presidential candidate Bernie Sanders accuse Freedman of wanting to dump the hospital to free up the land for a potentially lucrative sale. The site, near City Hall and a convention center, is desirable to developers, who could build condos or a high-end hotel there. Freedman declined to comment, noting in an email that he'd "have a lot to say" about the controversy in coming weeks.JUST WATCHED This is why US health care is so expensive Replay More Videos ...
