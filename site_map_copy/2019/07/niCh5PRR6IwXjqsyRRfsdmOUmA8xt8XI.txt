(CNN) More than 400 locations across the United States reached record-breaking temperatures last week. During that same span, only about 100 areas saw record-breaking lows.While this 4-1 record ratio can mainly be attributed to this week's heat wave, it doesn't stray too far from the 2-1 ratio of record highs and lows that we've seen over the past decade in the US.Weather variability can cause this ratio to change from year to year, such as in 2012, when record highs out numbered lows by a staggering 6-to-1 -- but the next year saw extreme highs and lows around the same pace.Record-high temperatures occurring twice as frequently as record lows directly reflects our climate crisis, as you would expect increasing the average temperature to increase the number of extreme highs, while extreme cold happens less frequently.As you increase the average temperature, you would expect to see more extreme hot weather while also seeing fewer instances of extreme cold.
