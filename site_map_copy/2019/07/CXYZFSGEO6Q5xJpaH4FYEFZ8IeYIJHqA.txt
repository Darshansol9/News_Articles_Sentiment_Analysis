(CNN) Authorities in Baltimore are looking for three suspects in connection with an attack on a civilian employee of the Baltimore Police Department that was captured on a surveillance camera and sparked outrage.The 59-year old victim can be seen in the surveillance footage crossing Albemarle Street as he is approached by two men and one woman, two of whom are on scooters. The footage shows the three assaulting the man, knocking off his headwear, beating him and then, police say, taking the keys to his vehicle.Investigators believe the suspects stole the victim's vehicle, which was parked on the same block, a police press release said.The video brought anger across the city, including from Zainab Chaudry, director of Maryland outreach for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).
