(CNN) Jesse Walaschek says 15 to 20 seconds saved him and his family.The 41-year-old, his wife and three kids -- ages 8, 6 and 4 -- had just left a fitness center at a shopping mall in the South Florida city of Plantation when a possible gas explosion Saturday shattered parts of the building, injuring at least 23 people, including two with serious injuries."We felt the loudest boom that you could possibly feel. I looked in my rear view mirror and it was just a dust cloud," Walaschek told CNN. "Had we walked out of that gym 15 seconds later, I would've been getting my kids in the car when it went off. I probably wouldn't be here, my kids wouldn't be here."A search of the blast zone has been completed, police said.

Among the injured was a child, but the injuries were not classified as serious, Gordon said.Read More
