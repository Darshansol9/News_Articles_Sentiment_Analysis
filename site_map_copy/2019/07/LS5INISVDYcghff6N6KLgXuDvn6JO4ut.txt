(CNN) Checking the temperature reading during this weekend's heat wave won't tell the whole sweltering story. It's going to feel a lot hotter.Blame the heat index , also called "apparent temperature." It's a combination of air temperature and humidity, and it measures what the body actually feels, CNN meteorologist Haley Brink said."We should pay attention because of the way we, as humans, cool down," she said. "We cool down by sweating, and that sweat evaporates off of our bodies, in turn decreasing our body temperature."When it is really humid outside, the rate of sweating decreases, so it actually feels warmer outside than it is," Brink said.So, Washington -- with a predicted temperature Saturday of 100 degrees Fahrenheit and relative humidity of 73% -- can expect it to feel like 111 degrees, she said. And Boston's forecast high temperature of 97 degrees, with relative humidity of 71%, will make it feel like 105.
