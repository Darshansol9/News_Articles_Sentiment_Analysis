(CNN) Puerto Rico's Justice Department is serving search warrants Tuesday on some of the participants involved in a group chat with Gov. Ricardo Rosselló that helped spur days of protest on the island, a department spokeswoman said.Last week, the department issued summonses for everyone involved in the private Telegram Messenger chat group with the governor, spokeswoman Mariana Cobian said. Though Cobian said all participants in the group were being summoned to appear before department officials over three days, she declined to provide a list of names.As part of the summonses, the chat participants -- which include 11 of Rosselló's top aides and Cabinet members -- were ordered to hand over their cellphones for inspection, Cobian said.Some of the officials have failed to comply with the summonses, she said, declining to elaborate.
