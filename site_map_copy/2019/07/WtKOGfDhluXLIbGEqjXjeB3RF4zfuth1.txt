President Trump and congressional leaders reached a two-year budget agreement which suspends the debt ceiling until July 2021 and eliminates the budget caps put into place in 2011. The agreement, which still has to pass Congress and then be signed into law, pushes the political battle over looming spending cuts and the debt ceiling deadline well past next year's elections. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN all sides wanted to get a deal done to avoid a stock market collapse and avert the fiscal fallout that would come if the debt ceiling wasn't raised. Republicans are happy because they'll get increased spending for defense, while Democrats are pleased because they'll get more money for domestic programs.2. UK prime ministerBritain should know who its next prime minister will be soon . The results of the Conservative party leader election will be announced later today. The winner of that race will not only lead the party but also replace Theresa May as prime minister. Pro-Brexit firebrand Boris Johnson is the favorite to win the job. Johnson, a former mayor of London, has been called one of the most divisive politicians of his generation.

Venezuela blackoutThe power is out -- again -- in Venezuela. It's the fourth nationwide blackout in the South American country this year. Officials are blaming it on a hostile "electromagnetic attack," but the exact cause of the outage remains unclear at this point. Power was restored to Caracas early this morning, the government said. The outages are exacerbating a broader political crisis that has gripped the country for years. Runaway inflation and food scarcity has crippled Venezuela, with tens of thousands leaving the country in a mass exodus.People are silhouetted by the lights of a vehicle as they cross a street in Caracas on July 22, 2019 during a blackout.4. Canada deathsPolice in Canada say there might be a connection between the killing of a young couple and the disappearance of two teens in the same region of British Columbia. The couple -- American Chynna Deese, 24, and her Australian boyfriend Lucas Fowler, 23 -- were found shot to death last week on a highway. Police have been searching for the two missing teens -- Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18 -- since Friday, after their car was found burning on the side of a road. (And while investigating the fire, police found the body of a man more than a mile away.) Police said it's unusual for investigators in northern British Columbia to have two "complex and dynamic" cases at once.JUST WATCHED Officials implore public for help after double homicide Replay More Videos ...

A pair of new studies say drug-resistant strains of the disease are indeed spreading through Southeast Asia , and that's raising fears of a "potential global health emergency." A strain that's resistant to multiple drugs has evolved and mutated into several new subgroups, the studies say. They have been found in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. The strains have rendered a widely-used drug essentially ineffective, leading to treatment failures at "alarmingly high rates." The new findings come as countries and health experts struggle to fight the parasitic disease. There have been some successes -- Algeria and Argentina were declared malaria-free in May -- but in other places, cases have been rising significantly.BREAKFAST BROWSERIP, ArtArt Neville was more than just one of the founding members of the Neville Brothers.
