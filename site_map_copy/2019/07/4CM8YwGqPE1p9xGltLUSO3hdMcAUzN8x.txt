(CNN) Protesters rallied in New York Wednesday on the anniversary of the death of Eric Garner, an African-American father who died after officers tried to apprehend him five years ago.The rallies took place a day after the Justice Department said it was declining to bring federal charges against New York police officer Daniel Pantaleo , who is accused of using a chokehold on Garner in July 2014. The decision angered Garner's family.Protesters demanded justice for Garner's death and called for Pantaleo and other officers to be fired, directing anger at New York Mayor Bill de Blasio."My son was killed five years ago today. And I'm still feeling that same pain," Garner's mother, Gwen Carr said at a rally in Foley Square in Manhattan as the crowd repeated after her.Addressing Mayor de Blasio, Carr said: "We have to get those officers fired. The ones who were on the scene that day who murdered my son."
