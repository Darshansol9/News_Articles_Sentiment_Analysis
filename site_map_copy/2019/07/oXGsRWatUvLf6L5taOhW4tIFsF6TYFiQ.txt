(CNN) Patrick Hoagland of Phoenix was down on his luck after getting laid off from his job as a forklift operator at a metal recycling company.

"I at first laughed and thought that was silly, but I kept thinking about it. I figured, why not?! There are millions of people in Phoenix driving around, someone might hire me."He printed out 200 copies of his résumé and hit the streets in search of work last week. Melissa DiGianfilippo saw him while she was driving through Phoenix."I was impressed with Patrick because it was 110° outside and what I saw was really unexpected," DiGianfilippo wrote in an email. "He was standing on the side of the road with a sign and a stack of resumes and a huge smile on his face."Read More
