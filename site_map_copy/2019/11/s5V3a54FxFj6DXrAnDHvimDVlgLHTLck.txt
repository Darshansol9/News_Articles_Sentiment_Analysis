(CNN) Syracuse University Chancellor Kent Syverud released a letter to the university community Monday detailing his plans to improve campus security and well-being after a spate of racist incidents plagued the campus earlier this month.While a student was arrested last week in connection to some graffiti and four students were suspended in connection with using a racial epithet against a fellow student, many of the reported events still remain under investigation and suspects have not yet been identified.Syverud says campus improvements will be made to campus security, student well-being, and campus engagement. He hopes to have these changes in place by the time students return from Thanksgiving break on December 2.The campus security improvements include the immediate deployment of 19 new residential community safety officers, installing new security cameras in stairwells, elevators, exterior locations and common spaces, and having public safety officers work increased shifts while classes are in session.University administrators hope to support their students' well-being by doubling the availability of health, wellness and counseling professionals, and extending the hours of offices dedicated to serving students, such as the Office of Multicultural Affairs, Disability Cultural Center and LGBT Resource Center.
