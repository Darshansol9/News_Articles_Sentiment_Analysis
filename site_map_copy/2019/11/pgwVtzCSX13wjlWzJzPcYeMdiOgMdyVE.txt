(CNN) The 5-year-old boy thrown off a third-floor balcony at the Mall of America in Minnesota has improved so much he's walking "perfectly" and attending school, according to a post on his family-run GoFundMe account."He loves being back to school and going to kindergarten at the same school his twin brother and sister go to," the family wrote Friday. "He gets out of the car every morning happy and blows kisses all the way in! He's a strong, happy boy. When his mommy asks him if she can look at his wound or asks how he's doing, he always responds with 'Mom, I'm healed, you don't need to ask me anymore.'"The boy, identified only as Landen, came home from the hospital in August with a limp, uneven legs from a broken femur and an open wound on the belly, the family wrote. Since then, he's undergone extensive physical therapy."He is now walking PERFECTLY with even legs AMEN," the family wrote. "The wound has finally scabbed over and new skin is growing, and we are still optimistic he will be off some of his medications soon."Plan to kill an adult didn't 'work out'Read More
