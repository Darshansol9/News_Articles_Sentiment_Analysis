(CNN) Antonio Brown has countersued a woman who accused him of rape, not only denying her allegations but also accusing her of defamation and causing the former NFL star to lose lucrative professional contracts.Brown, a free agent, filed his countersuit against Britney Taylor on Wednesday in his home state of Florida, two months after she filed a civil suit accusing him of rape and sexual assault.His filing in Broward County claims Taylor, a college acquaintance who became one of his offseason athletic trainers, became upset with him because he declined her requests to invest in a gymnastics business she was developing."Taylor's false accusations about Brown interfered with the contracts and business relationships he had with the NFL, as well as multiple businesses with whom he had contracts for sponsorships and endorsements, resulting in significant financial loss for Brown," the wide receiver's counterclaim reads.Brown's filing, like Taylor's suit, asks for a jury trial.
