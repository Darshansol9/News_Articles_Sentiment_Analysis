A former Georgia police officer was found not guilty of murder more than four years after he killed a naked, unarmed black man who was mentally ill. A jury in DeKalb County found Robert "Chip" Olsen guilty of aggravated assault, making a false statement, and two counts violating his oath of office, but acquitted him on two felony murder charges.
