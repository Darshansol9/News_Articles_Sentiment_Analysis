She said they've been doing this for years, apparently," according to the post. "She wants to drop and report them but is too scared because they said if anyone snitches they'll know who it was and they'll find a way out of trouble because they've 'gotten out of any investigation before' and will deny everything."The post has since been removed from the website.Despite policies, hazing continues in universitiesGreek life organizations — which include sororities and fraternities — are meant to be campus organizations focused on building friendships and future connections, with many members participating in volunteer work.
