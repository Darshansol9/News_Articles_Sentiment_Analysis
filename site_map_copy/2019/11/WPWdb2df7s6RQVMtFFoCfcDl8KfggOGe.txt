(CNN) The Starbucks employee who gave an Oklahoma police officer cups of coffee with the word "PIG" printed on the label has been fired, the company said in a statement Friday.The Kiefer police officer went to the Starbucks in Glenpool on Thanksgiving day to pick up five drinks, CNN affiliate KTUL reported. Kiefer Chief Johnny O'Mara told the news station a customer pointed out the label on the cups to the officer."What irks me is the absolute and total disrespect for a police officer who, instead of being home with family and enjoying a meal and a football game, is patrolling his little town," O'Mara wrote in a Facebook post , where he shared a picture of a cup with the "PIG" label on it.The coffee company called the incident "absolutely unacceptable" and said it is "deeply sorry to the law enforcement officer who experienced this.""The Starbucks partner who wrote this offensive word on a cup used poor judgement and is no longer a partner after this violation of company policy," the statement read. "This language is offensive to all law enforcement and is not representative of the deep appreciation we have for police officers who work tirelessly to keep our communities safe."Read More
