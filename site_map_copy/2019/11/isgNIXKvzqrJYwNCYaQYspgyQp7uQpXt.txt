(CNN) A Hawaii man is accused of conducting an elaborate cyberstalking campaign against a Utah woman and her father by sending unwanted repairmen, food deliveries and other visitors to their home.The father estimates that between August 2018 and March more than 500 people came to their North Salt Lake home at the alleged stalker's behest, and that some of the visits stemmed from the suspect "posting the family's address on Craigslist stating that the homeowner wants drugs and prostitutes to come to the house," according to a federal motion to detain the suspect.Loren Okamura, 44, is charged with two counts of cyberstalking, two counts of transporting an individual to engage in prostitution and a count of interstate threats, court documents show.There are few details available about the transporting-for-prostitution charges. US Attorney John Huber declined to provide information during a news conference, and Okamura's indictment says only that in June and July of 2018, he is accused of transporting the Utah woman he allegedly stalked to Hawaii with the intent that she "engage in prostitution."As for the threat counts, Okamura is accused of contacting the woman and, according to the indictment, telling her in an email: "Sleep with one eye open and keep looking over your shoulder you crazy b**** we are coming for you and your dumba** daddy and crazy a** mommy."Read More
