(CNN) Some 300,000 Chicago students returned to their schools Friday after an 11-day teachers' strike ended with a deal that will make "students' lives better," Chicago Teachers Union President Jesse Sharkey said.The agreement reached between Chicago Public Schools and the Chicago Teachers Union Thursday includes millions of dollars to reduce class sizes and bring more nurses, librarians and social workers to campuses."We're proud of what we accomplished," Sharkey said. "We moved the needle on educational justice" in Chicago, Sharkey added, nothing that deal is the first time that school nurses and social workers have been included in the teachers' contract with the city.Sharkey said some of the improvements will be noticeable to teachers and students right away, while others will take effect over time, including the protections related to class size, which he said will start in the second semester.Maria Moreno, the union's financial secretary who was at the negotiating table, said the deal is "unprecedented" and a "tremendous victory for our students in the public schools. We are finally going to start to see the beginnings of improvements of what these kids deserve."Read More
