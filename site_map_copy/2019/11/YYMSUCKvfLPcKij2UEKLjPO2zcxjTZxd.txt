(CNN) An advocacy group says it's paying $2.1 million so ICE will release some 200 detained immigrants in 20 states.The Texas-based nonprofit known as RAICES says it teamed up with a network of organizations and volunteers to make bond payments across the United States on Wednesday.Their aim: bringing more attention to the large number of immigrants who remain in US custody -- and giving hundreds of people a better shot at winning their cases."It's ridiculous that people are coming to this country to seek safety, and they're having to pay these outrageous amounts of money," said Blake Vera, interim director of the group's bond fund. "We're stepping in to eliminate that financial obstacle."Bond payments were still being processed Wednesday afternoon, according to the organization, and some people were expected to be released Wednesday evening.
