(CNN) The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals blocked the execution of Rodney Reed Friday, allowing a lower court to consider Reed's claim that the state presented false testimony and that he is innocent.The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles recommended earlier Friday that Gov. Greg Abbott grant a 120-day reprieve to Reed."This time is critical to allow for proper consideration of the powerful new evidence of his innocence and possible DNA testing that could help prove who actually committed the crime," said Bryce Benjet, Reed's Innocence Project attorney. "We hope that Governor Abbott will consider all of the facts in this case, and adopt the Board's recommendation as soon as possible."The stay of Reed's execution means the case will go back to a state judge in Bastrop County where he was convicted.Reed was sentenced to death more than 20 years ago for the 1996 assault, rape and strangling of 19-year-old Stacey Stites. He was scheduled to be executed November 20.
