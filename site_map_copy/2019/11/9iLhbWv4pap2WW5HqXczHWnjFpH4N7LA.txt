(CNN) You know what the say, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is all fun and games until one of the balloons goes down. Since the parade started marching balloons around Manhattan in 1927, the massive floating figures have occasionally come untethered, blown clear away, or been punctured, stabbed, deflated and subjected to all sorts of ignominy.While most of the balloon incidents are at least a little humorous (the hubris of man, to create such beasts!), a small handful of accidents have ended with people being seriously injured. Some of those cases have led the parade's organizers to change the rules regarding their most beloved -- and problematic -- parade participants. After all, a deflated Kermit here and there is just the way the parade floats, but there's nothing festive about people getting hurt.1927: Felix is released to the giant cat motel in the skyImagine you're a parade-goer in 1927.
