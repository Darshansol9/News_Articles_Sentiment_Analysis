(CNN) Renovations at Montclair State University in New Jersey uncovered a 112-year-old letter from the workers who built one of the original buildings on campus, the university said.Robert Kanaby, a demolition worker, found the letter inside a beer bottle while taking down a wall in the College Hall building in February."It's a very old brick wall, about 14 feet with three layers of brick," Kanaby said.
