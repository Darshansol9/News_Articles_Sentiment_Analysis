Coming soon to Twitter, you'll get to read all my thoughts and opinions on just about everything," says Simpson, 71, while surrounded by greenery outdoors.He also asks people to follow his new official account, @TheRealOJ32"It should be a lot of fun. I've got a little getting even to do," the NFL Hall of Famer says with a smile and without offering more details.The account's main photo is a badly lit image of Simpson in a suit and open collar. The banner photo is an old image of Simpson's Buffalo Bills No. 32 jersey and helmet. The account, with its location tagged as Las Vegas, is authentic, confirmed Simpson's attorney, Malcolm LaVergne.
