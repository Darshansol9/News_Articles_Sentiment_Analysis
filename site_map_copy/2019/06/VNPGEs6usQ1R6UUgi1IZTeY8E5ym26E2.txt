Homestead, Florida (CNN) As calls for action on the border crisis grow louder, a facility housing thousands of unaccompanied migrant children in Florida has become a major stop for Democratic presidential candidates.The facility in Homestead holds 2,300 immigrant children in a massive compound tucked behind a chain link fence. Posted on the fence is a stern warning: "U.S. Govt. Property NO Trespassing."Inside the compound, under the watchful eye of workers in blue shirts, children walk around in orange caps to shield them from the glaring summer heat. Across the street, protesters carrying signs that read "Free the Children" and "Shut it down" use step ladders to peek over the fence.Katie Berendsohn, one of the activists gathered outside the facility, said they noticed the orange caps worn by the children."They chose prison orange, which if you're trying to say that this is not a child's prison was really a rather foolish thing," Berendsohn said. "It really still is a prison for children."Josh Rubin demonstrates in front of the Homestead shelter in February.Read More
