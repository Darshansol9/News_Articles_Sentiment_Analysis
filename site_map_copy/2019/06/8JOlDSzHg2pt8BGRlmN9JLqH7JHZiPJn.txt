O'Neill said Friday.Last week, a respected chief and an experienced detective died within 24 hours of one another, O'Neill said. Friday, a "promising 29-year-old police officer with six years on the job" died behind the NYPD precinct in Staten Island, where he worked, the commissioner said."This is a mental-health crisis.
