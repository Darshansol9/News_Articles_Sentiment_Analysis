(CNN) NASA is gearing up for another moon landing, and it hopes to ensure that the next lunar spacewalk is as safe as possible with a prototype device focused on saving downed astronauts.To test it out, NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are turning to the deep seas.With its natural similarities to the surface of the moon, the ocean floor is the perfect environment to simulate a lunar environment. This is why the space agencies are turning to underwater habitat Aquarius in the Atlantic Ocean to run their tests.The ESA has a prototype device called the Lunar Evacuation System Assembly (LESA) that allows a single astronaut to deploy the structure and lift their incapacitated crewmate into a mobile stretcher before bringing them to a pressurized lander.The entire process of deploying and securing their crewmate to the stretcher should take less than 10 minutes.Read More
