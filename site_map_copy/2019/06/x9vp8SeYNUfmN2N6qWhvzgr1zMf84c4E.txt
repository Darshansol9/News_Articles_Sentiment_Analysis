(CNN) Mastercard has announced that it well let transgender and non-binary people use their chosen name, rather than their legal or given name, on credit, debit and prepaid cards."For many in the LGBTQIA+ community, the name on their credit, debit or prepaid card does not reflect their true identity," the company said in a release . "As a result, for the transgender and non-binary communities in particular, the card in their pocket can serve as a source of sensitivity, misrepresenting their true identity when shopping and going about daily life."As part of its LGBT inclusion initiatives, the bank is offering a "True Name" card, which can be obtained through "a sensitive and private process free of personal questions.""We want to be a force for change to help address and alleviate unnecessary pain points [in the LGBTQIA+ community]," Randall Tucker, Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer for Mastercard said in the release.
