Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (CNN) The alleged gunman in the shooting of former Boston Red Sox star David Ortiz has been arrested, according to Jean Alain Rodríguez, attorney general of the Dominican Republic.Suspect Rolfi Ferreira Cruz, 25, has confessed to shooting Ortiz, police said in a statement.Authorities believe Ferreira Cruz and six other men were involved in the shooting of the MLB all-star.

Following the shooting, the charging documents say, the shooter fled the scene with his gun in hand.Bautista Almonte said investigators located the other five suspects -- who were in custody Wednesday-- after they spoke with Féliz García at a local hospital.Police were investigating two cars that were parked near the scene of the shooting, and a witness told police he saw Féliz García and the gunman get into one of the cars before the shooting, the documents say.Prosecutors asked that Féliz García be held for a year of pretrial detention, but defense attorney Bunel Ramírez Merán told CNN that he argued against the move and requested the judge postpone the decision so the defense could gather evidence.Merán plans to demonstrate to the court that his client poses no flight risk due to his "family, social and work ties," he said.The judge said he would rule on the request Wednesday.JUST WATCHED Video purportedly shows moment David Ortiz was shot Replay More Videos ...
