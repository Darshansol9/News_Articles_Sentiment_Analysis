(CNN) Harvey Weinstein retained two new attorneys to represent him against sex crimes charges, marking the latest additions in what has become a revolving door of legal teams in his case.Chicago-based attorneys Donna Rotunno and Damon Cheronis notified the court that they've been retained by Weinstein in documents dated Monday, June 24, and made public by the court clerk's office Wednesday.The pair are joining Weinstein's New York-based defense attorney, Arthur Aidala, who earlier this week submitted a motion to dismiss two of the five charges against Weinstein. The two new attorneys understand that the September 9, 2019, trial date is "non-negotiable," according to the court documents.Since he was first criminally charged last May , Weinstein has gone through a series of attorneys in his case. Earlier this month, high-profile attorney Jose Baez, who successfully defended Casey Anthony and Aaron Hernandez, withdrew from Weinstein's defense"First, Mr. Weinstein has engaged in behavior that makes this representation unreasonably difficult to carry out effectively and has insisted upon taking actions with which I have fundamental disagreements," Baez said in the filing.
