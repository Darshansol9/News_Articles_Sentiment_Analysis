(CNN) The skydiving plane that crashed Friday in Hawaii, killing all 11 people on board, was in another accident in California in 2016, according to National Transportation Safety Board records.The Beechcraft 65, manufactured in 1967, was being used as a skydiving plane as well on July 23, 2016 with 15 people on board when it stalled in the air three times and spun out before the pilot was able to land it. The 14 passengers on board, parachutists, were forced to jump to safety in mid-air.Authorities said all 11 people aboard the plane died in Friday's crash.There was substantial damage to the tail section of the plane in the 2016 incident, but that wouldn't have precluded it from ever flying again, NTSB member Jennifer Homendy, who is in Hawaii investigating Friday's crash, said at a news conference Sunday afternoon.The cause of the 2016 incident was determined by the NTSB to be pilot error."The pilot lost control of that aircraft and there was substantial damage to the tail section of that plane. But like other modes of transportation you would conduct repairs and make sure that that is inspected," Homendy said. "So we will be looking at the quality of those repairs and whether it was inspected and whether it was airworthy before it was returned to service."Read More
