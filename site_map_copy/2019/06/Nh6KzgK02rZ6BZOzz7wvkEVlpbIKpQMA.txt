(CNN) A large fire broke out early Friday at an oil refinery in Philadelphia, rattling the area with at least one booming explosion and lighting up the dark sky with huge balls of gas and flame.The explosion and fire came from a vat of butane -- one of the products that come from the process of refining crude oil -- at the Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery starting around 4 a.m., Deputy Fire Commissioner Craig Murphy said.Murphy confirmed during an afternoon press conference that propane was also in the vat.Social media recorded a massive fireball from the Philadelphia oil refinery early Friday.The refinery's fire crews have been fighting the flames with city fire crews in support, and the blaze has been contained to the general vat area, Murphy said.During the press conference, Murphy said the fire was not under control, but was "confined and contained."
