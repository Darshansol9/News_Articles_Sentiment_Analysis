This could have been a much worse incident," he said.The helicopter took off from the 34th Street heliport at about 1:32 p.m., NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill said, and it crashed on the roof of 787 Seventh Ave. about 11 minutes later.A fire broke out when the helicopter crashed, and the FDNY reached the roof and put out the fire quickly, FDNY Commissioner Daniel Nigro said.Tim McCormackThe deceased pilot has been identified as Tim McCormack, law enforcement sources said. His family has been notified, according to one source.At the time of the incident, moderate to heavy rain was falling in the city and visibility at Central Park was down to 1.25 miles. Winds were from the east at 9 mph.Based on interviews the NYPD conducted at the 34th Street heliport on Manhattan's east side, the pilot was waiting out the weather but for some reason decided it was okay to go, another law enforcement source told CNN.The pilot then flew around Battery Park on the southern tip of Manhattan, up the west side of the island and then, somewhere around the streets in the 40s, started to veer toward midtown Manhattan before ultimately crash landing, the law enforcement source said.It is unclear whether McCormack made an emergency call from the Agusta A109E helicopter before the crash."That's part of the investigation, to see if there was any contact made with air traffic control," NYPD Commissioner O'Neill said.Images from the scene of today's helicopter crash at 787 7th Ave. in Manhattan. #FDNY members remain on scene.

Adrienne Walsh, one of the department's first responders, described the roof scene as "a debris field that was on fire.""So, I immediately got on the radio to let command know what we had on the roof so they, down below, could start sending the appropriate resources up to us on the roof," she told reporters.Richardson said high-rise buildings present challenges, but the FDNY has ways to work around them.The crash landing of a helicopter damaged a Midtown Manhattan building."Within half an hour we had water on the fire and most of the fire extinguished," Richardson said.US Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, who represents the area in Congress, said the building at 787 Seventh Ave. was not equipped with a helipad. She called to ban non-essential helicopters from Manhattan."We cannot rely on good fortune to protect people on the ground.

The risks to New Yorkers are just too high," she said'You could feel the building shake'Nathan Hutton, who works in the building, told reporters that chaos ensued as the building shook and people tried to evacuate."It took a half hour to get from the 29th floor down to the ground floor.
