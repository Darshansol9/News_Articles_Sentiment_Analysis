(CNN) Bill Cosby filed an extensive appeal of his sexual assault conviction, arguing that it was flawed because the testimony of five accusers was "strikingly dissimilar" to that of Andrea Constand, the victim in the case.Cosby's 2004 assault on Constand and the incidents with the other women, which dated to decades ago, are too far apart and "remote and unduly excessive," the attorneys argued.Cosby, 81, is serving three to 10 years in a Pennsylvania state prison for drugging and sexually assaulting Constand at his home 15 years ago.
