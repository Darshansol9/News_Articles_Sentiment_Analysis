The organization used the show's main character, Leslie Knope, played by Amy Poehler, to thank spokeswoman Dana Loesch for defending gun rights."Hi, please take this down. I would prefer you not use a GIF from a show I worked on to promote your pro-slaughter agenda," Schur tweeted.Schur ended the tweet with a strongly worded message for the NRA directly from Poehler, as she doesn't have a Twitter account.
