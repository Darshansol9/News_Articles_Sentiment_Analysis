(CNN) There are new bus stop ads in Los Angeles that will cause Angelenos to do a double take."If there's a shooting, are you covered?" reads one ad in all capital letters. Another promotes "Mass shooting insurance," calling it "America's signature coverage."There's no actual insurance for sale. The ads are part of a campaign to raise awareness about gun violence and encourage action against it.The fine print on each ad: "On average, 100 people are killed by guns in the US every day. Although the violence is real, this insurance is not. It's a wake-up call to take action. Together, we can be Louder Than Guns and end gun violence."Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti's office launched the " Louder Than Guns " campaign to urge residents to find ways to bring an end to gun violence, the mayor's office said in a news release .

The campaign's "Gunsure Insurance" ads are posted at bus stops and on social media.Read More
