(CNN) Is anybody home? Astronomers have pinpointed two planets orbiting a nearby star that meet pretty much every requirement for supporting life. They're almost exactly the same mass as the Earth, they are billions of years old (which means life could have had time to evolve), and they're orbiting their star at a distance that would support things like water flow and habitable temperatures.JUST WATCHED This is what life on Mars could be like Replay More Videos ...

("Only" is relative -- 12 light-years is equal to 70,540,000,000,000 miles.) Research on the planets and their sun, published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics , reveals Teegarden's star seems to be stable, without large solar flares or other violent activity that could threaten the potential for life on the two promising candidates.
