(CNN) A group of students and their parents are seeking a class action lawsuit against the criminal mastermind in the college admissions scam and the universities named in the scandal, specifically calling for their college application fees back.The lawsuit, filed Friday in federal court in the Northern District of California, accuses William "Rick" Singer of carrying out a criminal scheme that helped less-qualified students gain admission into these universities."As a result of this coordinated, fraudulent scheme, conducted through wire and mail, unqualified students found their way into the admissions rolls of highly selective universities, while those students who played by the rules were denied admission," the suit said.The lawsuit also accuses the universities involved in the case of negligence for failing to maintain protocols and security measures to prevent such fraud."Each of the universities took the students' admission application fees while failing to take adequate steps to ensure that their admissions process was fair and free of fraud, bribery, cheating and dishonesty," the lawsuit said.
