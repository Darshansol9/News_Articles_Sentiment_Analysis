(CNN) Michigan State University's Board of Trustees decided Friday to hire an independent investigator to look into the university's handling of the Larry Nassar scandal.The investigation, to be conducted by the law firm of McDermott Will & Emery , will also look at how MSU handles current sexual assault claims on campus, according to MSU spokesperson Emily Guerrant and Nassar survivor Rachael Denhollander.Denhollander was the first woman to publicly accuse Nassar of sexual abuse, and the last of more than 150 women and girls to confront him in court during his sentencing hearing for criminal sexual conduct.She worked with MSU in selecting the firm, one she described as "one of the top firms in the world" to deal with this sort of investigation.Nassar survivors have called for an independent investigation for more than two years, and this one will permit MSU to "look at what went wrong, to span all the departments, and cite their failures and put steps in place to remedy the situation," Denhollander tells CNN.Read More
