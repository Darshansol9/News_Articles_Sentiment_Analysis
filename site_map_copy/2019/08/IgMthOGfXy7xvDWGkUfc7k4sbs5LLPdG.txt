(CNN) With Colin Kaepernick and Kobe Bryant in her player box, Naomi Osaka overcame another second-set hiccup to reach the third round at the US Open.The defending champion -- still playing with her left knee strapped after injuring it in Cincinnati about two weeks ago -- overturned a 3-0 deficit in the second to end the nine-match winning streak of Magda Linette 6-2, 6-4 as Wednesday's rain gave way to warm sunshine in New York.How did the Japanese-Haitian megastar -- who has dual Japanese and American citizenship -- feel about having Bryant and Kaepernick rooting her on in the city she used to live in?"It's really cool," Osaka said in her courtside interview. "But honestly I really wanted to finish as fast as possible because I didn't want them to stay in the sun too long."Colin Kaepernick watches Naomi Osaka's match against Magda Linette at Louis Armstrong Stadium on Thursday.Osaka will face Coco Gauff in a blockbuster Saturday after the teen sensation defeated Timea Babos in Thursday's night session.
