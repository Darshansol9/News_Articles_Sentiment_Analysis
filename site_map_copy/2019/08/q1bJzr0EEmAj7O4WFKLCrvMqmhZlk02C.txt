(CNN) A former Houston police officer who authorities said lied to obtain a search warrant for a raid in which two people died and five officers were injured has been charged with murder, a prosecutor said Friday.Gerald Goines, who had a 35-year law enforcement career, faces two felony murder charges, said Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg. A second former officer, Steven Bryant, is accused of tampering with evidence."The eyes of this community and the nation are on this case; it is critical to the public trust that we reveal the true facts about what, how and why two civilians were killed in their own home by members of the Houston Police Narcotics Squad 15," Ogg said in a statement.The two officers were part of the tactical team during the botched January 28 raid of a home that killed Rhogena Nicholas and Dennis Tuttle and injured officers who were part of that team. Goines was injured in the shooting.Goines obtained a warrant for a "no knock" raid from a municipal judge under false pretenses, which included claiming a criminal informant purchased heroin from a man at the address the day before and that the man selling drugs was known to have a gun, among other things, which meant there was no need for police to knock on a door before entering, Ogg said.Read More
