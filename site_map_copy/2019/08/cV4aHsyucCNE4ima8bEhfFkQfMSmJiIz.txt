(CNN) In one of Jeffrey Epstein's last interviews, he told a reporter for The New York Times that he had dirt on a number of famous people and that criminalizing sex with teenagers was a "cultural aberration."The interview with James B. Stewart , a Times columnist, staff writer at The New Yorker and acclaimed author, came a year ago at Epstein's mansion on the Upper East Side of Manhattan."The overriding impression I took away from our roughly 90-minute conversation was that Mr. Epstein knew an astonishing number of rich, famous and powerful people, and had photos to prove it," Stewart wrote in the Times on Monday"He also claimed to know a great deal about these people, some of it potentially damaging or embarrassing, including details about their supposed sexual proclivities and recreational drug use."Evidence to back up those claims was lacking, however.
