(CNN) Four Arkansas teens were going door to door to raise money for their high school football team when a woman held them at gunpoint, police say.The 10th-grade boys, who are all black and who were not identified because of their ages, were selling discount cards for restaurants and stores in Wynne, Arkansas, on August 7. Jerri Kelly, who told police that she is a former law enforcement officer and the wife of a county jail administrator, stopped them in front of her home, according to a police report.Kelly, who is white, said she saw the boys making a ruckus, according to the police report. She called the Wynne Police Department to report "suspicious persons" and in a later statement said, "All males were African American, and I know this residence to be white."Jerri Kelly was charged with four counts of aggravated assault, false imprisonment and endangering the welfare of a minor.As the boys approached her home, walking up her driveway and standing in her yard, Kelly picked up her revolver and came out to ask what they were doing, according to her statements. Even though they said they weren't stealing, Kelly told police, she instructed them to get on the ground.One boy told officers that he thought it was a joke until Kelly said to "get on the f***ing ground and spread your legs," the police report says.Read More
