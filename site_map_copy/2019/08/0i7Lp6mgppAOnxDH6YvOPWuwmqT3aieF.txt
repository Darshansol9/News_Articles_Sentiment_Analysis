El Paso, Texas (CNN) White supremacists and neo-Nazis have found a racist's virtual paradise that authorities believe has now become home to three hate-filled rants by suspected mass shooters.That place -- the open internet forum 8chan -- is being blamed for fostering violent white supremacists in the US and other countries.8chan has not responded to CNN's inquiries.The suspect in Saturday's massacre in El Paso, Texas, put what police called a "manifesto" on 8chan shortly before opening fire at a Walmart in an attack that killed more than 20 peopleThe writer said he was inspired in part by another manifesto full of white supremacist language posted on 8chan by a person identifying himself as the man who killed 51 people at two mosques in New Zealand earlier this year. That atrocity was also cited in an 8chan message before a shooting at a synagogue in Poway, California, by someone identifying himself as the suspected gunman.
