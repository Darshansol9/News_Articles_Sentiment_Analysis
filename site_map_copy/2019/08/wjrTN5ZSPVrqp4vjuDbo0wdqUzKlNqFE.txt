(CNN) Some are teenagers accused of threatening to gun down classmates. Others allegedly issued social media warnings of attacks on store customers or coworkers. Still others are said to have vowed to unleash small arsenals against victims based on their race or religion.More than two dozen people have been arrested over threats to commit mass shootings in the weeks since 31 people were killed in one August weekend in shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio,The raft of cases follows a directive by the FBI director immediately after those two massacres for agency offices nationwide to conduct a new threat assessment in an effort to thwart more mass attacks.The FBI was concerned that US-based domestic violent extremists could become inspired by the attacks to "engage in similar acts of violence," the agency said in a statement.At least one person now facing charges told deputies he simply wasn't being serious, they said. Joke or not, though, such comments in many places are a felony."After the mass violence we've seen in Florida and across the country, law enforcement officers have a responsibility to investigate and charge those who choose to make these types of threatening statements," the sheriff's office involved in that case wrote on its Facebook page.Here are the known threats with publicized arrests that law enforcement agencies have investigated since the Dayton and El Paso shootings:August 4: A man from the Tampa area called a Walmart and told an employee he would shoot up the store, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.
