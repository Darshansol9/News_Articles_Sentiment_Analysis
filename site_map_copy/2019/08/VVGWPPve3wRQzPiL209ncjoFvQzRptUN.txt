(CNN) Gov. Ron DeSantis has directed the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to take over a criminal investigation into the case of multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who pleaded guilty 11 years ago to state prostitution charges and split his short sentence between jail and work release.Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw requested the state take over the criminal inquiry and said his office will continue to handle an internal review of how his deputies handled the detention of Epstein, who now faces federal charges of conspiracy of sex trafficking.Bradshaw wrote to DeSantis that the public interest would be served by an FDLE investigation into the aspects of the case, from sentencing to Epstein's time in jail."Floridians expect and deserve a full and fair investigation," DeSantis said. In a letter to the commissioner of the FDLE the governor also asked for the agency to take a preliminary look into "matters beyond the work release and into other irregularities concerning the case's disposition."DeSantis assigned the case to the state's attorney's office in a neighboring district to Palm Beach County.
