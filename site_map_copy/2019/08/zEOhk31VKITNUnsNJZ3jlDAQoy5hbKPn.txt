(CNN) A captain at a Rhode Island detention facility has resigned after witnesses said he drove a truck toward a line of protesters who were demanding the center cease its cooperation with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.While Capt. Thomas Woodworth has resigned, The Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility said in a statement, the incident "remains under active investigation by the Rhode Island State Police and under internal investigation" by the detention center.The incident Wednesday night was captured on video. Five demonstrators were hospitalized, according to the group that organized the protest, Never Again Action , which describes itself as a collection of Jewish people and their allies protesting ICE and the government's treatment of migrants."Given what happened on Wednesday, he should have been fired on the spot and faced criminal charges," said Matthew Harvey of Never Again Action. "But the result is the same, he's no longer working there and that's progress."Dozens of people had showed up to protest the contract between ICE and the facility in Central Falls, the activists' news release said. As of Thursday morning, there were 129 ICE detainees housed at the facility, ICE told CNN.Read More
