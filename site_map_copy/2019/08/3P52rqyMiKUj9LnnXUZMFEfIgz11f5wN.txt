(CNN) The Essex County Improvement Authority will lend $120 million to the city of Newark to replace pipes that are contaminating water with lead, officials announced at a news conference Monday.The replacement of the pipes will come at no cost to Newark residents, Essex County Executive Joe DiVincenzo Jr. said.There are about 18,000 privately owned lead service lines within the city that need to be replaced to fix the issue, which was expected to take 8 to 10 years. The new funding will allow the city to fix these lines in 24-30 months instead, authorities said.Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said the city has already fixed about 770 lead-service lines, but this funding will speed up the process."We are going to use some of these contracts and expand it. We are going to bring more crews in obviously, have a project manager over this and begin putting more people on the ground simultaneously to do this kind of work throughout the city," Baraka said.Read More
