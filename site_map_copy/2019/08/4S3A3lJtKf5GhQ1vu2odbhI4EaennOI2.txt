(CNN) Emotional reserves tapped by two mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, the nation has not yet grasped the violence that left an almost identical number of people wounded on the streets of Chicago.A weekend of gun violence left seven people dead and 52 people wounded in the third-largest American city, according to the Chicago Police Department.Officers responded to a total of 32 shooting incidents throughout the weekend beginning Friday night, said Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson at a Sunday afternoon press conference. The conference was held outside an entrance to the city's Douglas Park, where one of the weekend's multi-victim, multi-perpetrator shootings took place. Johnson said the weekend's violence was "gang and narcotics related."Conveying his condolences to the people of El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio as well as the citizens of Chicago, Johnson said all have been "affected by a tragic level of violence within a society that's become immune to these types of shootings."The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Justice Department are helping Chicago police investigate the weekend's gun violence, Johnson said. He added the violence could be related to a basketball tournament that took place earlier in the day. The violence broke out at night after most people had left the tournament.Read More
