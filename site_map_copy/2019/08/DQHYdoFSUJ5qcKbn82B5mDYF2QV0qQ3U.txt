NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism John Miller said authorities are currently treating the investigation into the rice cookers as if they were "hoax" devices.He said police have reviewed video from the subway complex where two of the rice cookers were found. It showed a white man in his 20s or 30s with dark hair and a shopping cart leaving the two rice cookers at the scene, he said."Obviously we would like to speak to this person," Miller said.
