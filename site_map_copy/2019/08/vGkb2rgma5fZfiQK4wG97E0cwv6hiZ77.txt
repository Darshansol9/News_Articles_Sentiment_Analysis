(CNN) Ultimate Fighting Championship star Paige VanZant wants equal pay.The mixed martial artist said she makes more money through sponsored social media posts than she does in competitions."With endorsements , I make way more money sitting at home posting pictures on Instagram than I do fighting," she said in an appearance on "Ariel Helwani's MMA Show.""If I were to stop everything I do outside of fighting and just fight, I would be at a loss. By a long shot."VanZant broke her arm in a February fight that sidelined her for the rest of the year. But with TV commentary jobs and Instagram sponsorships, that hardly affected her earnings. VanZant has more than 2 million Instagram followers.
