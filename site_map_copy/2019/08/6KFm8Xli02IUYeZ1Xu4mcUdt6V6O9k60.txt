(CNN) The union representing New York City police officers has unanimously approved resolutions of no confidence in police Commissioner James O'Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio.The 27-member delegate assembly of the Police Benevolent Association released the resolutions on Wednesday, calling for O'Neill's resignation and asking Gov. Andrew Cuomo to remove de Blasio from office. Both resolutions cite the recent firing of Officer Daniel Pantaleo , who was involved in the fatal arrest of Eric Garner in 2014, in part as a cause for the union's demands.One resolution says O'Neill "yielded to inappropriate pressure from anti-police advocates and elected officials, as well as unlawful interference from Mayor Bill de Blasio, to render unjustified findings and penalties" on Pantaleo.It also accuses O'Neill of failing to address an "acute mental health crisis" among the New York Police Department, which has lost nine members to suicide so far this year, among other things. O'Neill was a police officer for 34 years prior to becoming commissioner in 2016.PBA spokesman Albert O'Leary told CNN this is not the first time the union has issued a resolution of no confidence. He said the last one was against former NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly in 2004.Read More
