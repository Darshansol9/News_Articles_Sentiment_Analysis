(CNN) A Louisiana judge has ordered the city of Baton Rouge to turn over the psychological evaluation used in the hiring of former police officer Blane Salamoni, who was involved in the 2016 fatal shooting of Alton Sterling.Salamoni was fired last year for his role in the shooting, and last week, the Baton Rouge police chief apologized on behalf of the department for hiring the officer who already had a history of misbehavior prior to the shooting."We're sorry because he should have never been hired. And while we obviously cannot change the past, it is clear that we must change the future, and I sincerely apologize for the actions of the past and the role that our profession has played in building barriers in communities of color in Baton Rouge," Baton Rouge Police Chief Murphy Paul said.The psychological report will show that Salamoni should have never been hired with the department, attorneys for Sterling's family told reporters Monday after the judge handed down his order.The report will prove the city must be held responsible for the officer's conduct while he was employed with the Baton Rouge Police Department, attorney Mike Adams said.Read More
