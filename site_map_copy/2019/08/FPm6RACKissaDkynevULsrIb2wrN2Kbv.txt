"I was talking to one of the officers who had the graze wound to the head and he had two little boys -- they looked like they were 9 or 10 years old, 8 or 9 years old -- and kept on thinking about how their lives would have changed with just a little more difference in space."Police officers escort a bystander away from the scene of the shooting in Philadelphia on Wednesday.How people are reacting"I think it's clear this man should not have been on the streets," Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said Thursday."He was a felon before he was handling this weapon."Ross said the suspect was armed with a gun when he was arrested.Hill has a 12-page criminal record with charges including burglary, aggravated assault and taunting a police animal.
