(CNN) Top-tier collegiate golf is coming to Howard University, thanks to a gift from one of the NBA's biggest stars.Steph Curry announced Monday that he is partnering with the historically black university to fund the first six years of a new NCAA Division I golf team.The Golden State Warriors star and three-time NBA champion is an avid golfer and says he was inspired to help kick off a program when a current Howard senior struck up a conversation about golf with him this year."Golf is a sport that has changed my life in ways that are less tangible, but just as impactful," Curry said in a release. "It's a discipline that challenges your mental wherewithal from patience to focus, and is impossible to truly master. ... I feel really honored to play a small role in the rich history of Howard University, and look forward to building their first men's and women's golf teams with them."Men's and women's golf teams -- yes, there's another layer to Curry's plan. Curry says he is very invested in gender equality within the program and will sponsor two women's and one men's scholarships in the team's 2020-21 inaugural season.Read More
