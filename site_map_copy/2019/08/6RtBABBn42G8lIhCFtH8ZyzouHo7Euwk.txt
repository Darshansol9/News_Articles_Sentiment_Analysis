New York (CNN) The New York Police Department officer at the center of the arrest that allegedly led to Eric Garner's death is expected to learn as early as Friday the latest decision in a process that could end his career, two senior law enforcement officials and a city official told CNN.Daniel Pantaleo's career has been in jeopardy since he was caught on video in July 2014 putting the unarmed black father in an alleged chokehold. Now, after a spring disciplinary trial, NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Trials Rosemarie Maldonado is expected to deliver, perhaps by week's end, her recommendation on whether Pantaleo should be terminated to Police Commissioner James O'Neill and officials with the city agency charged with NYPD oversight.Civilian Complaint Review Board leaders and Pantaleo's attorney then will have about two weeks to draft a response, and O'Neill has the final say; he's never hinted at what he may do. The crux of the case remains whether Pantaleo used a chokehold, which is banned by the NYPD; the officer denies he used the move.The internal police process comes to a head just weeks after Attorney General William Barr declined to bring federal charges against the embattled officer. The issue of Pantaleo's employment also took center stage during Wednesday night's Democratic primary debate , as protesters screamed, "Fire Pantaleo!" while New York Mayor Bill de Blasio shared the stage with other candidates for president."There's going to be justice. I have confidence in that," de Blasio said during the debate , adding that Pantaleo's professional fate should be decided within the next 30 days. "For the first time, we are not waiting on the federal Justice Department, which told the city of New York that we could not proceed because the Justice Department was pursuing their prosecution."Read More
