"Stapleton prides itself on being a forward-thinking diverse community."The effort to change the community's name goes back to the 1990s, when the community was first built on the 4,500-acre site of what was once the Stapleton Airport -- Denver's aviation hub. The airport was demolished in 1995 and all that remains today is the control tower (now a restaurant), and the name Stapleton."Stapleton, the name, is about an airport, a very successful airport, and a lookback at the economic engine of the area for decades," Burnett said. "There's not one statue of Ben Stapleton out here."In fact, what was one the original airport's runways is now Martin Luther King Boulevard, which connects Stapleton to Denver's historically black Five Points neighborhood.The effort to scrub the Stapleton name from the Denver map has picked up steam lately.In May, the Denver School of Science and Technology, DSST: Stapleton, became DSST: Montview after a push from its students. And a city rec center with the name also recently committed to changing it.In April, a Denver-area subdivision called Swastika Acres was renamed Old Cherry Hills after a unanimous city council vote.

That same year, similar statues in New Orleans had to be dismantled in the middle of the night.Georgia state law prevents the removal of Confederate monuments, so the city of Atlanta responded by adding markers to help put them in historical context.Wei, the Colorado state historian, thinks Mayor Stapleton should be relegated to history books and museums, but he hopes he's not forgotten."He should be remembered and discussed for the lessons he provided," Wei said, adding that he understands the concern of those who argue that erasing the names of historical figures with offensive views by today's standards can be a slippery slope."There may not be a line to be drawn, only a discussion to be had."As for Stapleton, the community name, Stalnaker, the activist, insists the fight to change it, will go on."We have a lot to learn in understanding why folks voted the way that they did," she said.But Burnett says the path to a future name change will soon get much more difficult. Stapleton is currently still bound by the rules of the neighborhood's developer, which make it relatively simple to change the name.But, In 2021, state law will apply, which requires a majority of the property owners to approve a name change -- a steep effort considering just about one-third of the owners cast a ballot in the referendum at all.
