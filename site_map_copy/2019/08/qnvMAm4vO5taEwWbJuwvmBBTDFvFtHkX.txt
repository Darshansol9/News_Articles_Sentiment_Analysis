New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio would not say if he believes Daniel Pantaleo should be fired from the New York City Police Department.Earlier today, a judge recommended that Pantaleo be fired following his controversial involvement in the death of Eric Garner. So far, he's been suspended from the department, but the Police Commissioner James O'Neal will make the final decision on his employment.A reporter just asked the mayor this: "Do you agree that he should be fired?""Again, what I am talking about today is a fair and impartial process has occurred. Thatâ€™s all I have to say," said de Blasio, who is also a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.Later, another reporter asked, "Mayor, do you believe that the recommendation was just?""I believe the process was fair and impartial," he responded.Some context: The issue of Pantaleo's employment took center stage during Wednesday night's Democratic primary debate, as protesters screamed, "Fire Pantaleo!" while de Blasio was on stage.
