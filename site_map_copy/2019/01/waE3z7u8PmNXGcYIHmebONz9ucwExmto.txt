(CNN) Change is coming to men's restrooms in New York -- and it's going to be a big help to fathers all over the state.A new law requires all new or renovated buildings in New York that have bathrooms used by the public to make changing tables available to both men and women.The rule, which passed in April 2018 but didn't go into effect until the new year, applies to restaurants, stores and movie theaters as well as state facilities such as parks and offices of the Department of Motor Vehicles.At least one changing table must be available to both genders on each floor of a building that is accessed by the public, according to the law. The legislation also states that building managers should post clear signs showing the location of the nearest available changing table.There was no previous state law that required changing tables in bathrooms used by the public, according to a statement from the office of Gov. Andrew Cuomo when the legislation passed.
