Our government will reopen...but we will be keep cooking hot meals for the next week so that everyone has time to get paid!

Andres tweeted Friday.The #ChefsForFeds campaign opened a kitchen and caf√© this month near the White House, then soon expanded to 12 states and Puerto Rico. The effort also offers to-go meals for families, plus essentials like diapers, pet food and cat litter."We believe that no person should have to go through the pain of not knowing what to feed their children," the chef said in a video announcing the endeavor.Plenty of people took the help. Andr√©s' team on Wednesday served 11,400 hot meals, organizers tweeted.BIG news!

That vow quickly spawned the pop-up project.And if the government shuts down again in three weeks, Andr√©s said he'll be back with more food."Obviously we're going to be watching what happens during these next few weeks," Andr√©s said Friday . "If for some reason things go wrong again, we will be there for them."The chef also called on leaders to reach a permanent solution."Now, we need our politicians to show us why we put them in power," he said. "They need to lead us."
