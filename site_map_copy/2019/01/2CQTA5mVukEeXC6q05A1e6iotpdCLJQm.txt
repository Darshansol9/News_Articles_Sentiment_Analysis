He smiled and nodded at Guzman, who sat at the defense table wearing a dark navy blue suit and matching tie.While testifying against his onetime mentor, Zambada repeatedly referred to Guzman, 61, in Spanish as "mi compadre," or "my buddy." Zambada said he has known Guzman since he was 15, and that Guzman is the godfather of his youngest son.Zambada testified that his responsibilities with the cartel included clandestine meetings with high-ranking members of law enforcement and Mexican military officials who helped facilitate smuggling operations and assured the assignment of "friendly" officers in key regions.
