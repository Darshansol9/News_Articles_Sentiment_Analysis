Christy Mirack was murdered more than 25 years ago. Thanks to a piece of gum and a water bottle, her killer has now been sentenced to life in prison. Raymond Rowe pleaded guilty to first-degree murder, rape and related counts in Mirack's killing, according to the Lancaster County District Attorney's Office.
