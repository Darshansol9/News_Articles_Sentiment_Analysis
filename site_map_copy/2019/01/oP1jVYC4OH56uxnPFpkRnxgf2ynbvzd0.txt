"New Orleans traditionally (has) addressed adversity with satire, often biting satire."Within hours of the soul-shattering loss, an iconic local bakery came up with cookies featuring a photo in sugar of the chief of the referee team that blew the call, then slashed through his face with red icing.Louisiana eye doctor offered to "GLADLY provide no cost eye exams to all NFL officials prior to next season to prevent the atrocity that occurred tonight.

At least one local lawmaker is on board -- and says it should happen "smack during" Super Bowl LIII, now dubbed "LIE" by locals.It'd be a reprise of the legendary 2010 parade that ferried Saints heroes on signature floats from the region's biggest Carnival organizations after the team brought home the Lombardi Trophy after winning the Super Bowl that February."Whenever New Orleanians are happy, they have a parade," Allman said. "When they grieve, they have a parade. And when they're angry, they have a parade."
