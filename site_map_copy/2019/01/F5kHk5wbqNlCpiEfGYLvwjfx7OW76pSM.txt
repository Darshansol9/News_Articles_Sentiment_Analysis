When a narcotics unit raided the house, officers swiftly came under fire, and a pit bull charged the first officer through the door, he said.When Monday afternoon's raid was over, two suspects were dead and five officers were injured , four of them suffering gunshot wounds.The first officer fired a shotgun blast, killing the dog. Suspect Dennis Tuttle, 59, initially retreated but returned with a .357 Magnum, shooting the officer in the shoulder, the chief said. The officer collapsed onto a couch in the living room.As the other narcotics officers charged through the door -- which Acevedo described as a "fatal funnel" -- the second suspect, Rhogena Nicholas, 58, tried to wrestle the shotgun away from the officer on the couch. Police quickly shot her.Rhogena Nicholas was killed trying to take a gun from an officer, police say.More gunfire was exchanged as the 54-year-old officer who breached the door -- the officer who knocks down the door goes in last -- charged into the fray, realizing his fellow officers were in trouble.Read More
