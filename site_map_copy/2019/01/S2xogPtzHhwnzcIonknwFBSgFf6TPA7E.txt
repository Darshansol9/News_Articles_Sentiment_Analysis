(CNN) Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday suspended embattled Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel, blaming him for failures in the response to the Parkland school shooting.The new governor criticized the lawman's handling of the February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School."Sheriff Israel has repeatedly failed and has demonstrated a pattern of poor leadership. He failed to protect Floridians and visitors during the tragic Fort Lauderdale International Airport shooting in 2017," DeSantis said in a statement. His executive order states the sheriff's office "failed to contain and maintain security" during the Fort Lauderdale Airport shooting in 2017, which resulted in a breach of airport security.According to an "after action report" from Israel, the BSO's 30-year-old radio system went down because it was overwhelmed during the Fort Lauderdale shooting that left five dead and six wounded. The failure of the radio system added to the chaos that included SWAT teams not knowing where to land their helicopters."He failed in his duties to keep our families and children safe during the devastating shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14, 2018. These incidents demonstrate Sheriff Israel's repeated incompetence and neglect of duty. The families of the victims deserve accountability," DeSantis said.
