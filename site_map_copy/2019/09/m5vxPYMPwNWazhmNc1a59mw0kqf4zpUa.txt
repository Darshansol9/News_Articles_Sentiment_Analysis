He described the lawsuit as a "money grab.""Please allow the situation to play itself out. Antonio will cooperate," Rosenhaus told the sports network. "In time, Antonio will be cleared.

They are what they are," he said.Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said: "I'm just trying to show up and play football and try to prepare. (The Miami Dolphins are) a good team. I'm going to get ready for them. Things that don't involve me, don't involve me."Taylor, who lives in Memphis, Tennessee, said it was a difficult decision to speak out. According to the lawsuit, she has suffered insomnia, weight loss, almost-daily panic attacks and contemplated suicide."I have found strength in my faith, my family and from the accounts of other survivors of sexual assault. Speaking out removes the shame that I have felt for the past year and places it on the person responsible for my rape," her statement said. "I will cooperate with the NFL and any other agencies; however, at this time, I respectfully request that the media please respect my privacy."What the lawsuit allegesIn June 2017, according to the lawsuit, Taylor was staying in one of Brown's Pittsburgh-area homes when he exposed himself to her and kissed her. She pushed him away and left the room, the lawsuit says.She brushed off the episode because she felt her professional relationship with Brown was important, but later that month, the lawsuit says, she was at his Miami home, where they were watching a church service on a tablet, when he began masturbating behind her and ejaculated on her back. She called her mother, who advised her to leave the premises, she alleges.Brown later fired her, and sent her notes referencing the incident and accusing her of and her mother of trying to get money out of him, the lawsuit says, providing alleged screenshots of the messages.After the two sexual assaults, the lawsuit says, Taylor stopped communicating with Brown. In February and March 2018, Brown sent her messages expressing contrition and trying to re-establish a training relationship, the lawsuit says.Taylor agreed, and the lawsuit asserts she ended up adding other duties, such as babysitting and scheduling.JUST WATCHED Antonio Brown signs with Patriots after Raiders release Replay More Videos ...
