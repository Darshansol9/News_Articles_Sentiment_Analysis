An agreement "in principle" has been reached between the US and the Taliban, President Trump's special envoy for the country says. The deal would see the US pull almost all of its 14,000 troops from five bases across Afghanistan within 135 days, if the Taliban keeps its end of the deal, envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said. This all needs final approval by Trump, though. If the deal goes through, it would end the longest war in America's history: an almost 18-year-long conflict sparked by the September 11 terror attacks.JUST WATCHED Four presidents, four strategies: The US' wars in Afghanistan Replay More Videos ...

West Texas shootingThe man who killed seven people in a shooting rampage in Texas over the weekend had been fired just a few hours before the violence began. But the shootings didn't happen because he was fired , an FBI official said. The shooter was already "enraged" when he showed up to work. The man sprayed the road with bullets after police pulled him over on a traffic violation. He later hijacked a mail truck and shot people at random before police killed him. The victims ranged from 15 to 57 years old and included a US mail carrier and an Army vet . A 17-month-old girl and three law enforcement officers were among the 25 people injured.JUST WATCHED Slain mail carrier's twin sister recounts their last call Replay More Videos ...

US Citizenship and Immigration Services said it will re-open some pending cases of those applying for relief from deportation because of medical conditions. USCIS had told these families a few weeks ago that the agency was no longer considering such requests, except for certain military exceptions. That set off an outcry (and news media coverage) that caused the agency to slightly reverse course.JUST WATCHED The immigration fight has lasted decades, and neither side is winning Replay More Videos ...
