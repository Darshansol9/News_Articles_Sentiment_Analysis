BrexitNot so fast. That's what a rebel alliance of British lawmakers is telling Prime Minister Boris Johnson about his plans to pull the UK out of the European Union without a deal. The cross-party group of lawmakers won a vote yesterday to seize control of the parliamentary agenda. Today, they will try to force a bill through Parliament that would stop the so called no-deal Brexit from happening on October 31. They fear that leaving the EU without an agreement will devastate the British economy. But Johnson says he'll seek early elections if the lawmakers rule out a no-deal Brexit. Johnson believes the threat of a no-deal Brexit will strengthen his negotiating position with the EU because any financial calamity that results from it wouldn't just hurt the UK, it would hurt Europe, too.

Walmart and gunsYou can get pretty much anything at Walmart, but it's about to get a lot harder to find guns and ammo there. The mega retailer says it will stop selling handgun ammunition and "short-barrel rifle ammunition" (the kind that can be used in assault-style weapons). Walmart is also asking that customers no longer openly carry guns into its stores ( Kroger did that, too ). Walmart CEO Doug McMillon says these changes were spurred by the El Paso, Texas, mass shooting -- which happened in a Walmart -- as well as recent shootings in Dayton, Ohio and Midland and Odessa, Texas. He also sent a letter to Congress demanding lawmakers "do their part" to stop gun violence. Walmart will, however, continue to sell long barrel deer rifles and shotguns and much of the ammunition for those weapons.JUST WATCHED Walmart will stop selling some guns and ammo in wake of shootings Replay More Videos ...

The countries perpetuate the conflict by supplying weapons to the various parties involved and thereby prolong the suffering of the Yemeni people, says a member of the UN-commissioned Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen. UN investigators have prepared a "confidential list of possible perpetrators" of rights violations. More than 91,000 people have been killed since 2015 in Yemen's war, which is a battle between a Saudi-led coalition that supports the Yemeni government and Iranian-backed rebels.JUST WATCHED Attack on Yemen prison kills more than 100 people Replay More Videos ...
