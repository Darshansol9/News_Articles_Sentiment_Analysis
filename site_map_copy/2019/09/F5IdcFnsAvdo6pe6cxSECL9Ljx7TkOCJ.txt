(CNN) Attorneys representing one of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers have requested a meeting with Prince Andrew, Duke of York, to discuss his relationship with the late Epstein, one of Epstein's associates and the accuser, according to a letter obtained by CNN.In the letter, attorneys for accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre requested the meeting — in New York, London or "any other place you may designate" — to discuss and "explore" the prince's relationship with Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, a British woman who has been accused of assisting Epstein in his sexual abuse, and their client.Attorneys Bradley Edwards and David Boies write in the letter that they are "puzzled" and "disappointed" that the prince did not cooperate with the attorneys' request for a meeting years ago when a photo surfaced in numerous media reports appearing to show him with his arm around Giuffre and Maxwell in the background.The Duke of York's office confirmed receipt of the letter, according to documents obtained by CNN. Maxwell and her representatives have previously denied she engaged in sexual abuse or sex trafficking.JUST WATCHED Hear Epstein accuser speak outside courthouse Replay More Videos ...
