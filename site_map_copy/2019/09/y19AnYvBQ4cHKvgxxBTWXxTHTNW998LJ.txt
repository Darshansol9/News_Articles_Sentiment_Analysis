An ICE officer opened fire and wounded a man in a Nashville grocery store parking lot as the officer attempted to make an immigration arrest. The officer fired two shots after a driver he was trying to arrest during a fugitive operation drove toward the officer while fleeing the scene, ICE spokesman Bryan Cox said, citing initial reports.
