Dorian has wreaked havoc in the Bahamas and we're only now starting to get a sense of the extent of the destruction left in its wake.Neko Gibson is the founder and owner of BahamasEvac services in Nassau. He spoke to CNN shortly after returning from Abacos, where he has been assisting in evacuation and rescue operations."Everybody's trying to do the best that they can," Gibson said Wednesday morning. "Problem is the winds and weather that has been a hazard for traffic to get in and out of Abaco."He praised the authorities for their tireless work and said that most of the runways were still unusable with only one operating in the south.
