(CNN) A federal judge in Florida handed down a loss Monday to Jeffrey Epstein's accusers, who have for years been trying to get payments and undo Epstein's 2007 plea deal in a sex trafficking case.US District Judge Kenneth Marra ordered the case brought by Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 against the US closed, ruling the federal government doesn't owe them any money, and that the court couldn't invalidate provisions in the plea deal relating to any alleged co-conspirators because they weren't a party to the case.The validity of those provisions "will have to be litigated with their participation if any prosecution against them is ever brought," Marra wrote. "Any decision by this court on that question is meaningless without their participation in this proceeding."The judge in February ruled that the government had violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) when it failed to notify the accusers of the nonprosecution agreement it had entered into with Epstein in 2007.But the accusers' request for restitution is "essentially a request for money damages from the Government, which is not allowed under the CVRA," Marra said in his opinion.Read More
