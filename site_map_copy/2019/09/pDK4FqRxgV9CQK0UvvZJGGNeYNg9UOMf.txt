(CNN) A series of new firearm laws will go into effect in Texas on Sunday just hours after a shooting left five people dead in the western part of the state.The laws will further loosen gun restrictions in a state that's had four of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern US history. They will make it easier to have guns just a month after a shooter stormed a Walmart in El Paso and killed 22 people.Here are the sweeping firearm laws going into effect:Weapons on school groundsKris Brown, president of gun violence prevention advocacy group Brady, criticized the bill going into effect September 1."Many states took the opportunity in the last two years to learn lessons from the tragedies in Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, Parkland, and the every day gun violence that plagues our citizens, and enacted new laws to protect public safety through expanded background checks and extreme risk laws," Brown said."Texas lawmakers, instead ... doubled down on an NRA led agenda to encourage guns everywhere, no matter the risks and costs to safety."Marshals at schoolsHouse Bill 1387 loosens restrictions on how many armed school marshals a school district can appoint.Guns in foster homesHouse Bill 2363 allows some foster homes to store firearms and ammunition in a safe and secure place for personal protection. Proper storage must be followed, the bill says, including putting firearms and ammunition together in the same locked locations.Weapons in apartmentsHouse Bill 302 bans homeowners or landlords of rental property from prohibiting residents from lawfully possessing, carrying, transporting or storing a firearm or ammunition in the property.Handguns during a disasterHouse Bill 1177 prohibits residents from being charged with a crime for carrying a handgun while evacuating from a state or local disaster area.Firearms in places of worship"We have learned many times over that there is no such thing as a gun free zone. Those with evil intentions will violate the law and carry out their heinous acts no matter what," state Sen. Donna Campbell, co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement. "It makes no sense to disarm the good guys and leave law-abiding citizens defenseless where violent offenders break the law to do great harm."The bill will make things clearer, she said."The existing statute is confusing and clunky when it comes to clearly stating the rights of licensed Texans to carry on the premises of a church. This bill provides clarity of the Legislature's intent to treat churches in the same manner as other privately owned establishments in Texas."
