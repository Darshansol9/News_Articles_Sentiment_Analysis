These connections are facilitated through a website where people can request help or offer to volunteer."It was built by Houstonians to help Houston," Marchetti told CNN. "So when another storm threatens Houston or its neighbors, it's obviously a bit personal. It has been a sight to behold, watching Houstonians quickly snap back in to the attitudes of Harvey, asking, 'How can I help someone?' and coming together to help others. There is a resiliency and helpfulness in this city, that is worth bragging to high heavens about."To date, CrowdSource Rescue has been used during 14 incidents around the US and registered more than 18,000 rescuers and volunteers, according to its website.Read More
