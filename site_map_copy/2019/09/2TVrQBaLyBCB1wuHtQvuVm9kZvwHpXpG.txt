(CNN) A Michigan police officer who was fired after a black man spotted a framed Ku Klux Klan application inside his home told investigators the item is just part of his antique collection, a new police report shows.Charles Anderson was fired from the Muskegon Police Department on September 12 following an investigation after potential homebuyers said they saw a framed KKK application and Confederate flags while touring his five-bedroom home.The City of Muskegon released a 421-page report Monday detailing the investigation's findings. In an interview included in the report, Anderson told investigators that he stored a framed blank copy of a Ku Klux Klan membership application from the 1920s in a room dedicated to his "extensive" antique collection.Anderson said one of his passions is US history, specifically the late 1800s to the 1960s, and he likes to collects items from that period. He removed most of his collection to prepare the room for real estate showings, but forgot the application was still hanging on the wall, the report states."If they had asked me I would've been more than happy to explain. I would've apologized, advised that I meant no harm by it and I would explain that it is from the 1920's, it's dated. It's not filled out. It has no one's name on it and it was part of history and that's ... I mean ... it was a mistake," he told an investigator, according to a transcript of his interview.Read More
