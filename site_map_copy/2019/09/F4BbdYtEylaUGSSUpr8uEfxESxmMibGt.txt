(CNN) Tropical Storm Humberto was dropping rain on the Bahamas' Abaco Islands as it began to crawl away Saturday evening, bringing the kind of stormy conditions the islands don't need after Hurricane Dorian ravaged them nearly two weeks ago.A tropical storm warning that had been in effect for the northwestern Bahamas was lifted, the National Hurricane Center said in its 5 p.m. ET advisory.At that time, the storm was about 70 miles north of Great Abaco Island with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph.Humberto is expected to move farther from the Bahamas as Saturday wears on, but not before it drops up to 6 inches of rain on some islands. That would be difficult for the Abacos or Grand Bahama, where Dorian left at least dozens of people dead and hundreds missing."Even if you're just talking 2 to 4 inches (of rain), you have to remember a lot of these homes, they don't have roofs on them. A lot of the buildings are already structurally compromised, so even a 50- or 60-mph wind can cause even more damage," CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said.Read More
