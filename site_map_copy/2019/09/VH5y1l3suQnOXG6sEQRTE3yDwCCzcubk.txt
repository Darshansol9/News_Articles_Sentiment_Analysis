(CNN) The largest US Hispanic civil rights group's national board voted unanimously Friday to urge major manufacturers and retailers to stop selling costumes based on racial stereotypes.The League of United Latin American Citizens will contact companies -- including Amazon and Party City -- that make or sell "so-called costumes based on race-based stereotypes which feed into prejudice against Latinos" and demand they "immediately remove these items from their inventory list," LULAC CEO Sindy Benavides told CNN in a statement."This line of merchandise should be banned because it fuels the growing anti-immigrant resentment in our country triggering such violence as the mass shooting in El Paso where the suspect admitted his hatred against Mexicans," she said, referring to the August massacre that left 22 people dead at the hand of a suspect who police allege wrote an anti-immigrant document espousing white nationalist and racist views."There is no place for profiting from racial stereotypes and demeaning 58 million Latinos who are a vital part of this country," Benavides said.The LULAC vote was taken a day after CNN asked the group to respond to photos of costumes sold by Party City, Spirit Halloween, Rubie's Costume Company and on Amazon. CNN affiliate KRQE had earlier reported on shoppers' reaction to a "Mexican Man" costume for sale at a Spirit Halloween store in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The vendors are among the nation's largest or claim to command a major share of the Halloween market.Read More
