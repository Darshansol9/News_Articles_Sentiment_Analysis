(CNN) Michigan State University has been fined a record $4.5 million in connection to the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said."What transpired at Michigan State was abhorrent, inexcusable, and a total and complete failure to follow the law and protect students," DeVos said in a statement on Thursday. "Michigan State will now pay for its failures and will be required to make meaningful changes to how it handles Title IX cases moving forward. No future student should have to endure what too many did because concerns about Larry Nassar and William Strampel were ignored."The fine stems from Michigan State University's "systemic failure to protect students from sexual abuse," the Department of Education said in a release. That $4.5 million total is "the largest Clery Act fine ever," DeVos said, referring to the federal campus safety law.DeVos spoke on a conference call Thursday with reporters announcing the conclusion of the Department's Title IX and civil rights investigations into the university. She called the probes "focused, careful and thorough."The Education Department said it concluded MSU did not properly disclose and collect campus crime statistics, issue warnings to the campus and notify safety authorities.
