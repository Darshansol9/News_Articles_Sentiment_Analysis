(CNN) A Florida city's Deputy of the Month program was designed to improve relations between law enforcement and the community, but it got off to a rocky start when a commission member called one of the recipients "a rogue police officer" and accused him of arresting the panel member falsely.Deputy Joshua Gallardo was one of the officers recognized by the Tamarac City Commission at last week's meeting. The commission was honoring the deputies of the month for the first half of 2019. City officials had the idea for the award last month and plans to honor deputies on a semiannual basis.After the ceremony, Tamarac Commissioner Mike Gelin congratulated all the officers, and called Gallardo back down."It's good to see you again," Gelin told Gallardo. "You probably don't remember me, but you're the police officer who falsely arrested me four years ago, you lied on the police report. I believe you're a rogue police officer.
