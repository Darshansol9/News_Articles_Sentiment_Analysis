(CNN) Harvard University received almost $9 million in gifts from Jeffrey Epstein, but none after he pleaded guilty to prostitution charges in 2008 in Florida, the school's president said.Epstein gave gifts between 1998 and 2007, but the university rejected a donation from Epstein after his 2008 guilty plea, President Lawrence Bacow said in a message to the Harvard community Thursday.One endowment and one fund had an unspent balance of $186,000 from Epstein's gifts, a review found, and that will be donated to organizations that support human trafficking and sexual abuse victims, Bacow said.The largest gift was $6.5 million to support the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics in 2003, Bacow noted, but the university also received other gifts totaling approximately $2.4 million."Jeffrey Epstein's crimes were repulsive and reprehensible," Bacow wrote. "I profoundly regret Harvard's past association with him."Read More
