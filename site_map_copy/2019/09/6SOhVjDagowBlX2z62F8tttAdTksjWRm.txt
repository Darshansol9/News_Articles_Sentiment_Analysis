(CNN) A 3-year-old girl lit up her Wisconsin community after she donated hundreds of dollars to her local police department's K9 division, all through the power of lemonade.It started out as just a way to keep a little girl busy.

But when Germantown Police Chief Peter Hoell stopped by and posted a photo of Lainie and the stand on the department's Facebook page, it got much bigger.Lainie and her lemonade ended up making over $700. By the end of the weekend, people were coming from across town to try Lainie's lemonade, with some donating upwards of $50 to the cause.Read More
