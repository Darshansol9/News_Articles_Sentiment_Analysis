Campaign 2020The main draw for the third Democratic presidential debate was supposed to be the first on-stage showdown between Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. There were some fireworks there, but the main action seemed to come from the younger (and lower-polling) candidates, like Juli√°n Castro, Beto O'Rourke, Pete Buttigieg and Cory Booker. They took on their higher-polling elders -- Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders -- with mixed results. Castro delivered the sharpest attack of the night, a jab about Biden's memory (and thus, his age) that made the audience gasp and some of the other candidates step in and chastise him.2. Census questionChief Justice John Roberts cast the deciding vote against the Trump administration's attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. But he only did it after changing his position behind the scenes , sources told CNN in this exclusive report. Roberts was all set to join the Supreme Court's four conservative justices and rule for the administration. But he changed his mind -- and his vote -- because he believed the administration's rationale for adding the citizenship question was contrived.

RussiaRussia's ruling party suffered big losses in Moscow's municipal elections. Now, members of the country's opposition say the ruling party is retaliating via nationwide raids .
