(CNN) After spending nearly his entire life in the US Jimmy Aldaoud was deported to Iraq, where he died of natural causes two months later. Now his body has been allowed to return home.Aldaoud's remains were flown to Detroit on Friday for burial, according to a statement from Michigan Congressman Andy Levin . The 41-year-old Iraqi national died of complications from diabetes in early August after being deported to Iraq in June.The congressman's office coordinated with Aldaoud's family, US and Iraqi officials and funeral homes in both countries to arrange the transport of Aldaoud's remains back to Michigan.

"My only hope is that Jimmy's family feels some sense of relief now that his body can be buried in his home country, next to his mother."Aldaoud and his family came to the US lawfully as refugees in 1979 when he was six months old, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officials told CNN earlier this month. His parents and three siblings became US citizens, though he never did.Read More
