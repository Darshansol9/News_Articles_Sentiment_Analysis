(CNN) A Massachusetts appeals court Monday overruled a Boston judge who insisted over prosecutors' wishes that a man arrested at last week's "Straight Pride Parade" be criminally prosecuted.The ruling is a win for Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins, a reform-minded prosecutor who said many of the 30-plus arrests at the parade were not worth prosecuting.Last week, when prosecutors moved to dismiss some of those charges, Boston Municipal Court Judge Richard Sinnott refused. He arraigned many of the defendants anyway.Rollins filed an emergency petition last week challenging Sinnott's constitutional ability to do that, and the state's Supreme Judicial Court ruled in her favor on Monday.The appeal, which pitted an elected progressive prosecutor against a tough-on-crime judge, was specific to one protester's case.
