(CNN) A CNN commentator's 8-month-old baby is on the road to recovery after receiving a liver transplant less than two weeks ago at Duke University Hospital.Bakari Sellers' daughter Sadie was born in January with a rare liver condition that placed her on the transplant list for three months, Sellers said Thursday morning on CNN's "New Day.""She's doing well. She kept me up last night," Sellers said. "She is coming back to life and showing us those glimmers in her eyes. We are just happy to be at Duke. Happy to have the care that we got. We're just very thankful at this time and very thankful to the donor's family who saved our daughter's life and many lives as well."Sadie was born with biliary atresia, a condition in infants in which the bile ducts outside and inside the liver are scarred and blocked, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). The disease affects roughly 1 out of every 12,000 infants in the US, the NIDDK added. Sadie's twin brother Stokely does not suffer from the disease.Bakari Sellers holds his twins, Sadie and Stokely. Sadie is now on the road to recovery after receiving a liver transplant less than two weeks ago.Sellers, a former South Carolina House member, was joined on "New Day" by Dr. Alisha Mavis, a pediatric liver transplant specialist at Duke Children's Hospital. Mavis encouraged people to enroll in the donor program which has more than 100,000 people waiting for a transplant.Read More
