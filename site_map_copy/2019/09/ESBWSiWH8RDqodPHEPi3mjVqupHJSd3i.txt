(CNN) The judge overseeing the bankruptcy case for opioid-maker Purdue Pharma issued an interim order late Wednesday allowing the company and its subsidiaries to continue paying its employees, former employees and retirees.The company estimates it will pay about $26 million in wages and benefits, including bonuses. The pharmaceutical giant and maker of the painkiller Oxycontin filed for bankruptcy as part of its plan to settle the litigation brought by more than 2,000 counties, municipalities and Native American governments who say the company fueled the opioid crisis.Purdue Pharma's long-standing annual incentive program pays out based on performance of the employee and the company. It's in the best interest of the creditors and those who will ultimately receive payouts from the company, the judge said.The actual payout earlier this year for calendar year 2018 was $33,290,000, according to court filings.During the initial bankruptcy hearing Tuesday, none of the 70 attorneys participating had any objection to the motion to continue paying employees and retirees though the bankruptcy trustee opposed it, according to CNN's Jean Casarez, who was present at the hearing.Read More
