(CNN) A major marine heat wave in the Pacific could spell disaster for the coral reefs along the coastline of Papa Bay near Hawaii's Big Island.Researchers fear warming ocean waters could cause more coral bleaching, which could lead to some of the most widespread loss of coral that Hawaii has ever experienced.Coral bleaching happens when corals are stressed by changing ocean conditions and expel the algae living in their tissues, which causes them to turn completely white. If the stress continues and the loss of algae is for a prolonged period of time, the coral will eventually die."Coral reefs are the most biodiverse marine ecosystems on the planet -- 25% of all marine species live in association with coral reefs," Jamison Gove, a research oceanographer for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), told CNN. "Coral reefs provide habitat for fish that serve important ecosystem functions and provide sustenance for local people."In addition, coral reefs break up ocean waves and swell, creating a barrier that protects coastlines from storms, waves and flooding. They are also important to the economy in Hawaii, as vibrant coral reefs are a huge tourist attraction for divers and snorkelers.Read More
