(CNN) A judge took "no action" during a Monday bond hearing for Maria Domingo-Garcia, an undocumented immigrant mother who was breastfeeding at the time she was detained in Mississippi's historic raids last month.Her attorney, Ray Ybarra Maldonado, called the judge's action "a shock" and said it shows the "outrageous the lengths (the government) is taking to try to keep her away from her children.""This is just a delay tactic to keep her in custody and away from her family," Ybarra Maldonado told CNN. "Her 5-month-old needs her."Domingo-Garcia was detained in early August, before which she had been breastfeeding her daughter to put her to sleep, her attorney has said.
