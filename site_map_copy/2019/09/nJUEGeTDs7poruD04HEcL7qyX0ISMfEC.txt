(CNN) A makeup artist who worked for television personality Charlie Rose for 22 years is suing him for sexual harassment, saying he created a toxic work environment where women were sexually harassed, dominated and diminished, according to court documents filed on Thursday.Gina G. Riggi says Rose routinely ridiculed her physical appearance and made inappropriate remarks about her weight, often humiliating her in front of her friends and colleagues."Throughout the workday, and at work events, Mr. Rose routinely groped and pawed at his female staff, pressed himself against them, kissed them, pulled them toward him, whispered in their ears, stared at their breasts, looked down their shirts, and otherwise subjected them to inappropriate and unwanted physical contact," according to the lawsuit. "Mr. Rose commented on their physical appearance, asked inappropriate questions about their personal and romantic lives, and barraged them with late-night phone calls. In many instances ... he made explicit sexual overtures."Rose's lawyer, Jonathan Bach, told CNN that Rose "vehemently denies and will vigorously contest these allegations.""Among other things," Bach said, "the allegations in the complaint are completely inconsistent with written statements made by the plaintiff to Mr. Rose, including 'I love working for you at your show, and would love to be part of any show that you host', 'I consider it an honor to be a member of your team,' and 'hope to see you more often! Please stop by anytime (smiling emoji)."Read More
