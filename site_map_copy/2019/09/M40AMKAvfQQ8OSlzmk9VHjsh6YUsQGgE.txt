(CNN) The married couple accused of killing a 72-year-old man and then escaping while being transported from New York to Arizona were recaptured after a tip that they were hiding out with an acquaintance on federal probation for selling meth, the US Marshals Service said Thursday.Blane and Susan Barksdale were located and arrested by a team of Navajo County Sheriff's deputies and US Marshals in the remote community of Punkin Center, northeast of Phoenix, US Marshal for the District of Arizona David Gonzales told reporters.Their acquaintance came out first, followed by a sobbing Susan Barksdale, who told authorities her husband Blane was still inside the home, Gonzales said.Blane Barksdale then stepped outside and initially responded to commands before becoming "verbally abusive to the officers, flipping them the bird, not responding to their commands, and deputy marshals at the scene had to use a Taser and what we call a bean bag round in the leg to take him down," Gonzales said.Barksdale was cooperative until he got about 15 feet from officers, Assistant Chief Deputy US Marshal Van Bayless said.
