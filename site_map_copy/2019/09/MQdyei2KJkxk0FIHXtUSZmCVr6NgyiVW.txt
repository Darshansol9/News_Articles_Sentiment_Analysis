He is no longer on the website$400,000 bribe for Georgetown acceptanceCalifornia businessman Stephen Semprevivo arrives Thursday for his sentencing hearing at federal court in Boston.According to the criminal complaint, Semprevivo conspired with scheme mastermind Rick Singer to bribe Gordon Ernst, the Georgetown tennis coach, to designate his son as a recruited tennis player and facilitate his acceptance to the university. But Semprevivo's son did not play tennis competitively.In August 2015, Singer emailed Semprevivo, his wife and their son instructions on what to email Ernst, such as claiming his son was a tennis star.Ernst has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering.Semprevivo's son's application to Georgetown falsely said he played tennis all four years of high school and was ranked in singles and doubles tennis, the complaint says. However, the son's applications to other schools did not mentions tennis, and the United States Tennis Association records do not show any match records for him.Still, Semprevivo's son was accepted to the school and enrolled in the fall of 2016. The Semprevivo family trust issued a check to Singer's fake charity, Key Worldwide Foundation, for $400,000, the complaint says.Between September 2015 and November 2016, Singer's fake charity paid Ernst $950,000 for his help getting Semprevivo's son, along with two other students, into Georgetown, prosecutors said in the complaint.After Singer was caught by federal authorities and agreed to work with investigators, he called Semprevivo in March 2019 to talk to him about how Georgetown was conducting an internal investigation to find out why tennis recruits were not playing for the tennis team.In a telephone back-and-forth with Singer, Semprevivo denied knowing that Singer got his son into the university using Ernst, according to the complaint."You know, I don't have any details, but I think that, I think that you need to be accountable for what you did," Semprevivo told Singer.
