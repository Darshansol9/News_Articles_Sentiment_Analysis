Ethan and Grayson Dolan, collectively known as The Dolan Twins, transformed Jeffree Star into Jeff Dolan, their long-lost fictional brother. The 19-year-old twins are a comedy duo who have 10.4 million followers on YouTube.In the video, titled, "Switching Lives With The Dolan Twins," Star traded his lashes and blonde wig for dark, short hair and a session at the gym."Today is going to be really trying for me," Star said in the video. "I don't know what's going to happen but I want to test myself and put myself in a different head space."Of course, the tables had to be turned. In a subsequent video , Star transformed the twins into, well, himself.After the makeover it's hard to tell the difference between the three men, proving that the power of makeup knows no bounds.
