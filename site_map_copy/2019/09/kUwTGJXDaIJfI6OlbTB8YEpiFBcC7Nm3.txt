Jonathan Schechter, the complaint alleges, repeatedly texted Pivarnick about her body and made advances. The complaint says that on one particular occasion, Pivarnick met Schechter in a parking lot outside the station and "grabbed and squeezed her buttocks, putting his hand so low that he also made contact with her vaginal area."According to the complaint, "Pivarnick made it clear that he should never touch her." After she left, Schechter allegedly sent her a text that read, "That ass! If you only knew the thoughts in my mind."Read More
