(CNN) A Texas judge assigned to the mass shooting case at a Walmart in El Paso has asked to be reassigned.Judge Angie Juarez Barill was assigned the case of suspected gunman Patrick Crusius . She asked for the case to be reassigned or transferred to a different judge because she knew one of the deceased's family members and she is running for chief justice for the 8th court of appeals, the El Paso District Court said in a statement.Since she will not run for re-election for her current position, her term will end in December 2020.
