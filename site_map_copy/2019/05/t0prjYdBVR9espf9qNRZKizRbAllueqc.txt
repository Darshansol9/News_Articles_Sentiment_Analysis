(CNN) A Rhode Island school district is facing accusations of lunch shaming after it announced a limited midday-meal option for students who are in debt on their school-lunch accounts.Warwick Public Schools announced on their Facebook page Sunday that any students who had unpaid balances on their lunch accounts would receive a sunflower seed butter and jelly sandwich until their balance was paid."In accordance with Warwick School Committee Policy EFB; Effective Monday, May 13, 2019, if money is owed on a paid, free, or reduced lunch account a sun butter and jelly sandwich will be given as the lunch choice until the balance owed is paid in full or a payment plan is set up through the food service office," the post read.Throngs of furious parents have commented on the post."Just give the kids lunch," one parent wrote. "We already lost a janitor, science teacher, don't have air conditioning, we can't spring for a chicken patty for a hungry kid? What if this is their only meal of the day?"
