(CNN) The City of Los Angeles has renamed a nearly 4-mile stretch of road from "Rodeo Road" to "Obama Boulevard," in honor of the country's first African-American president.The location is significant, the city said, because Obama held his first campaign rally in Los Angeles on February 20, 2007, at Rancho Cienega Park. The park sits on Rodeo Road, right across from W. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard."For every child who will drive down this street and see the name of the first Black President of our country, this boulevard will serve as a physical reminder that no goal is out of reach and that no dream is too big," tweeted City Council President Herb Wesson after the renaming Saturday.Rodeo Road, which runs through a historic black neighborhood, is not the first strip to be named in honor of former presidents. The district where the road sits is also home to Washington Boulevard, Adams Boulevard and Jefferson Boulevard.Wesson introduced the motion to rename the stretch of road back in 2017.Read More
