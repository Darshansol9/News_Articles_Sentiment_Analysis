(CNN) Judy Clark, a former radical activist who spent nearly 40 years in jail for her role in a 1981 robbery of a Brink's armored truck in suburban New York, was released from prison Friday, a corrections official said.Now 69, Clark was convicted of murder in the Nyack, New York, robbery that left security guard Peter Paige and Nyack police officers Edward O'Grady and Waverly Brown dead. She was granted parole last month."While this is a wonderful day for Judy Clark and her family, she recognizes that news of her release may cause upset to the victims' families and wants to express her ongoing concern for these communities," Clark's family said in a statement. "She plans to live her life outside, as she did inside, in atonement for the harm she caused."Clark participated in the 1981 robbery with other activists, and described herself as a "single-minded fanatic ... at war with America" and "a blinded revolutionary," according to New York State Department of Corrections records.Prosecutors have criticized the parole board's April decision, describing Clark as a "cold-blooded cop killer" who chose to participate in "bank robbery, anarchy and murder."Read More
