April 10, 1912 - The Titanic sets sail on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York.April 14-15, 1912 - The luxury liner hits an iceberg in the North Atlantic around midnight and sinks in less than three hours.1,517 people died and 706 survived out of 2,223 passengers and crew, according to the US Senate report on the disaster.The Ship:The estimated cost of construction was $7.5 million.At the time, the RMS Titanic was the largest passenger ship afloat.The ship's length was 882 feet, 9 inches, and it weighed 46,328 tons. Its top speed was 23 knots.The wreckage is located about 350 miles off the southeast coast of Newfoundland.What was the cause?In April 1912, there were about 300 icebergs in the North Atlantic shipping lanes, the most seen in the route between Europe and North America in 50 years.The abundance of icebergs that year would also be something the Titanic's experienced captain, Edward Smith, would not have predicted. He'd been sailing the North Atlantic for 26 years and had not reduced the Titanic's speed despite receiving warnings of bergs ahead of his ship.The iceberg punctured five of 16 supposedly watertight compartments designed to hold water in case of a breach to the hull.Investigations at the time blamed Captain Smith for going too fast in dangerous waters, initial inspections that had been done too quickly, insufficient room in the lifeboats for all passengers, and a nearby ship's failure to help.Many maritime safety reforms were implemented as a result of the findings of the investigations.Victims and Survivors:There were 329 1st class passengers aboard. 199 survived.There were 285 2nd class passengers aboard. 119 survived.There were 710 3rd class passengers aboard. 174 survived.There were 899 crew members aboard. 214 survived.Smith went down with the ship, and his body was never recovered.Frederick Fleet, one of the crew members who first alerted Smith to the iceberg, was rescued and survived.Notable Passengers:Survived -- The "Unsinkable" Margaret (Molly) Brown - wife of a silver mine manager, helped command a lifeboat and nursed injured survivors of the Titanic.- J.
