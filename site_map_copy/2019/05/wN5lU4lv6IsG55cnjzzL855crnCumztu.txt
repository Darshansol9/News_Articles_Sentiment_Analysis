(CNN) A fatal shoulder injury has resulted in the death of the 24th racehorse at the famed Santa Anita Park in California.The three-year-old horse, named Commander Coil, suffered the injury Friday in a gallop while training, according to a statement from Santa Anita Park's owner, the Stronach Group."Equine shoulder injuries are rare, especially for a horse that is galloping as opposed to breezing or racing. A comprehensive evaluation will be completed to understand what might have caused this uncommon injury," the statement said."The Stronach Group remains committed to operating Santa Anita Park with stringent protocols that prioritize the health and safety of horses and riders first and foremost."The park implemented reforms on March 15, the group said, and since then there have been over 80,000 gallops in training with no other fatalities.Read More
