(CNN) Houston geared up for more heavy rain late Friday into Saturday after a frantic night of pounding storms, flash floods and reports of high water and stranded motorists.Houstonians were advised to stay put in their homes Friday morning as high water lingered."If you don't have to go out this morning, don't go," said Jeff Lindner, meteorologist with the Harris County Flood Control District.There is not a lot of rain expected this morning, Lindner said, so the respite will give water levels a chance to recede.Three to six inches of rain fell overnight in the central, western, and southern parts of the county, which includes Houston, with bayou and creek flooding and water on the streets. Some homes and businesses also were flooded, Lindner said.More heavy rain laterWhile there was a lull in the heavy rain Friday morning, CNN meteorologist Gene Norman said, another round of battering storms was expected Friday night going into Saturday.It would be another blow for the already rain-soaked region already."This has been a week-long slow-moving train wreck, where some people have seen more than a foot of rain," Norman said.Engine 55, Ladder 55, District 46, Ambulance 55, Medic 24 and Rescue 42 responded to a vehicle upside down and submerged in a flooded ditch for unknown time, found one occupant trapped but still alive and effected a successful extrication. pic.twitter.com/RqEA0PWNjP — Houston Fire Dept (@HoustonFire) May 10, 2019The intensity of the storm overnight brought out the first responders.Rescuers raced to vehicles stuck in flooding on a major interstate Thursday night and to help other motorists trapped on other thoroughfares as slashing rain -- accompanied by hail and lightning -- deluged the region."Houston is no stranger to flooding, but it always seems to come at the worst time," Norman said, referring to storms during overnight hours.In one instance, rescuers responded to a vehicle upside down and submerged in a flooded ditch and the occupant was "trapped but still alive," the Houston Fire Department tweeted.Police tweeted that in the eastern section of the city, "barricades are up at two intersections to keep motorists from entering underpasses.Houston said I know it was like a billion degrees this afternoon, here's some golfball sized hail pic.twitter.com/B8aor510cI — Charlotte Weathers (@DeathByBlondie) May 10, 2019The Houston Police Department received reports of about 40 people trapped on East Interstate Highway 10 at Wayside by flood waters Thursday and sent a high-water rescue vehicle to the area, the department said.Video shows vehicles stranded on the interstate, a portion of which was temporarily closed in both directions.
