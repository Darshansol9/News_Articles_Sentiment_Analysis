Thinking it was a tire, he stopped to check. A blue pickup truck then pulled up behind his car and two Hispanic men got out.One of the men said, "Maleah looks very nice, looks very sweet," Vence told police.That's when the other man hit Vence in the head, and Vence blacked out.Vence said that at some point, he was going in and out of consciousness but he was aware of being in the back of a pickup with both children and three Hispanic men.When Vence came to, he said, Maleah was gone.Vence said he didn't fully regain consciousness until the next day. At about 6 p.m. Saturday, he awoke to find himself and the boy on Highway 6 in Sugar Land, southwest of Houston. Maleah was gone.Vence then walked to a nearby hospital and was treated.

She cried and covered her face as she stood next to the activist.Quanell X told reporters that he has seen video surveillance from a neighbor's camera that shows Vence leaving the apartment with a bottle of bleach and a laundry basket with a garbage bag in it.

MUST WATCH Police: Missing girl's stepfather changed his story 01:15Allegations of abuseMaleah and her two brothers were taken from their home and placed with a relative after allegations of abuse last year, the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services told CNN.Bowens said the children had not been abused, and that Maleah's head injury, which led to the allegations, was only discovered after a number of hospital visits. Maleah was first treated for a strange lethargy, and a week later, she fell and cut her head while sitting at a table. The doctors discharged Maleah without performing a CT scan, Bowens said.Maleah had a seizure five days later, and that's when doctors discovered bleeding on the left side of her brain and operated on her, Bowens said.Child Protective Services showed up a few days later, Bowens said."They didn't find anything because we're not those kinds of people," she said.But authorities soon placed Maleah and her two brothers with relatives, where they stayed until a judge ordered them to be returned home in February.
