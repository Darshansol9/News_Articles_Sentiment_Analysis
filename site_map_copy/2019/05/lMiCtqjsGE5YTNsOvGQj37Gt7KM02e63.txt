(CNN) It may be some time before we know for sure what caused a construction crane to come crashing down on a Seattle street, killing four people -- but some experts say human error could have played a role.On Saturday, a crew was disassembling a crane on the roof of a building that's being constructed as part of the new Google Seattle campus. The mast toppled, killing two bystanders and two ironworkers."I think there's a 99% chance that this is a human error cause and not a structural or mechanical failure by the machine," said Timothy Galarnyk, a construction safety expert.Five companies are now under investigation, and authorities are still working to discover exactly what caused the crane to collapse.It may take up to six months to complete the investigation, said Tim Church, a spokesman for the state Department of Labor & Industries. "This allows us access to interview workers, access company records and perform other investigative work," he said.
