(CNN) A lunchroom worker in New Hampshire who said she was fired for allowing a student to take food without paying hadn't been charging the student for anything for several months, her former employer said.Bonnie Kimball was fired from her job with Caf√© Services in April after a student at Mascoma Valley Regional High School in Canaan told her he didn't have money to pay for the items on his lunch tray. She said she let him take the food for free and he paid his $8 lunch tab the next morning.Kimball was dishonest and was let go for not following company procedures, Brian Stone, president of the company's school division said in a statement Monday. She hadn't charged the student for any part of the meal but told her manager she did. Every student in the line gets a lunch, so there was no reason for her to not charge the account, according to Stone."Despite the fact that the student goes through the line frequently according to the employee, this student hadn't been charged for anything for the previous three months," Stone said in a video statement posted on YouTube.In a written statement, Stone said the student was in line with a full lunch, as well as oven fries and two packages of cookies.

She then let the student take the full lunch allowed by school policy and also four additional items, Stone said.Read More
