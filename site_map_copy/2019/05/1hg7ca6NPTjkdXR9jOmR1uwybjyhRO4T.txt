(CNN) A Florida judge on Wednesday ruled that prosecutors can't use video surveillance in a handful of cases involving men accused of soliciting sex at a Florida day spa, a decision that could help Patriots owner Robert Kraft's efforts to suppress similar footage of him in a multicounty law enforcement operation.The ruling in Martin County came as Kraft's attorneys made similar arguments to suppress video and other evidence from being used in his prosecution in a separate courtroom in neighboring Palm Beach County.The judge in Palm Beach County did not rule Wednesday on the motion to suppress the Kraft video and ordered that the NFL team owner be in court for the next hearing on May 21.Kraft is one of dozens of spa patrons accused of receiving illicit massages at the Orchids of Asia spa in Jupiter.He and other defendants have pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor charges based on what authorities describe as evidence collected from the recordings and other surveillance methods.Read More
