In a video of the confrontation captured by the couple and widely shared on Facebook, Jessica Richardson described the incident as racism."This lady literally just pulled a gun because we out here and didn't have reservations for a lake we didn't even know we had to have reservations for," Jessica Richardson said in the video. "The only thing you had to do was tell us to leave, we would have left, you did not have to pull a gun."Read More
