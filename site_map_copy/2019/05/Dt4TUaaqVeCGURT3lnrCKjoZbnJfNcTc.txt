(CNN) A shark attack killed a 65-year-old man as he was swimming off the coast of Maui Saturday morning, according to authorities.The man, who was from California, encountered the shark about 60 yards off of Kaanapali Beach at around 8:30 a.m. local time, Dan Dennison, a spokesman for Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources, told CNN. A close friend identified the victim as optometrist Dr. Thomas Smiley.As a matter of protocol, authorities posted signs along a half-mile stretch beach warning people of a shark, Dennison said."Tom should be remembered for his zest for life. He enjoyed being around people and I don't think he liked being alone. He loved being around family and friends," Smiley's friend Gary Taxera told CNN.An incident report from the County of Maui Department of Fire and Public Safety -- obtained by CNN affiliate KHON -- says Smiley's family told authorities he had gone for a swim.Read More
