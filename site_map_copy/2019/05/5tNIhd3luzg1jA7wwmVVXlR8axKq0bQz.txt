(CNN) The first named storm of the 2019 season is now churning in the Atlantic, though it isn't expected to get very strong and poses no threat to the US East Coast, forecasters said.Subtropical Storm Andrea earned its name Monday evening, becoming the fifth year in a row that a tropical system has been named before the season officially begins June 1, CNN senior meteorologist Brandon Miller said.The trend has scientists wondering whether the season should start sooner, he said."The main practical reason would be to have people get prepared a couple weeks early," Miller said. "If one of these storms hits land in April or May, coastal residents might not have had a chance to prepare their homes and selves."
