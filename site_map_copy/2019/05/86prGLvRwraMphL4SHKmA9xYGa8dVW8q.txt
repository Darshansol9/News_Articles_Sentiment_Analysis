Halton Arena to grieve together at a memorial service. They sang their alma mater and chanted "forty-niners," the school's nickname.Then, they filled the courtyards surrounding the arena in a show of unity, holding their candles."It's just really powerful, honestly, to just see our community and our students and faculty and our chancellor, and just everyone coming together to support each other and to support the victims," senior Brittany Moose told CNN affiliate WSOC.
