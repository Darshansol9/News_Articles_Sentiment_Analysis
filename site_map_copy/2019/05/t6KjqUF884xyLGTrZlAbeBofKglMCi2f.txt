(CNN) A former slave who lay in an unmarked grave now has a headstone, thanks to a class of high school students in Massachusetts.Last fall, Dr. Linda Meditz tasked the students in her "Out of the Shadows" class with uncovering the story of a woman who was held in slavery in early New England and was buried in an unmarked grave, according to a statement from the school, The Academy at Penguin Hall.They found Lucy Foster.Foster was born into slavery in Boston and given as a "wedding gift" to Hannah and Jacob Foster, according to the school.
