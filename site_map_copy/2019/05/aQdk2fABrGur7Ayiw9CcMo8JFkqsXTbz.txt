It's fun!Following in the footsteps of great water cooler topics before it, such as the epic Yanny versus Laurel debate of 2018, comes a brand new argument ready to upset family dinners, divide group chats, and start bar fights across the nation:Is the Aperol spritz a good drink?What on God's green earth is an Aperol spritz?Traditionally, an Aperol spritz is made from first combining equal parts prosecco and aperol, an Italian ap√©ritif that is simultaneously fruity and bitter, in a wine glass filled with ice.
