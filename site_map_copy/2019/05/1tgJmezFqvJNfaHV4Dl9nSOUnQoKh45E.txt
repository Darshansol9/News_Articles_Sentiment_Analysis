Amanda Eller said she wished she prepared more before she went out on the hike.“I should have had a cellphone with me,” she said. “There’s a reason we carry them all the time.”She said she usually takes food, water and other supplies when she hikes — but on this one, she decided not to pack.“Be over-prepared," she told other hikers."It's a friendly jungle, there's not much that'll get ya. But still, be prepared."
