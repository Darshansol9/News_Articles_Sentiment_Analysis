Unfortunately, too many families have had to suffer at the hands of those paid to serve and protect us."Jean was killed in September 2018 when a Dallas police officer, Amber Guyger, mistook his apartment for her own and thought he was an intruder. Guyger was convicted of murder this month and sentenced to 10 years in prison.In Fort Worth, about 30 miles west of Jean's apartment, Jefferson, 28, was playing video games with her 8-year-old nephew when they heard what they thought was a prowler outside.
