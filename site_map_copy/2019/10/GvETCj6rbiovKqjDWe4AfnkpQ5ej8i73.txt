(CNN) The Florida man who killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend and her unborn child, and who allegedly killed a police officer during the ensuing manhunt, was sentenced to life in prison on Wednesday.A Florida jury unanimously voted not to recommend the death penalty for Markeith Loyd. He was convicted last week of first-degree murder, first-degree murder of an unborn child and attempted first-degree murder, along with two counts of attempted felony murder.The question of whether Loyd would get the death penalty had led to a contentious legal and political fight in the state. Before the trial started, then-Gov. Rick Scott removed the elected Florida state attorney from Loyd's case after she said she wouldn't seek the death penalty in his or any cases.Markeith Loyd was arrested in January 2017 after more than a month on the run.State attorney Aramis Ayala had argued that evidence showed the death penalty was overly expensive, slow, inhumane and did not increase public safety. Ayala said after "extensive and painstaking thought and consideration," she determined that pursing the death penalty "is not in the best interest of this community or the best interest of justice."She sued Scott over her reassignment, and the legal disagreement reached the state Supreme Court. The court ruled that Scott was within his right to reassign the cases.Read More
