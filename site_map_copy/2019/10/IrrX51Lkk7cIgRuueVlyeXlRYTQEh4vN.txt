(CNN) Dozens of people were arrested Thursday as protesters demanding action on climate change blocked traffic in New York's Times Square.Images on social media showed demonstrators from the group Extinction Rebellion sitting on the ground, circled around a green boat that said "Act now." Protesters wore orange life jackets and held up the flags of countries impacted by environmental disasters, including the Bahamas, parts of which were devastated by Hurricane Dorian last month.At least 62 people were arrested, according to a New York Police Department spokesperson.
