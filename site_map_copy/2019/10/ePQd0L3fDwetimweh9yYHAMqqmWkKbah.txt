A hearing to address the preliminary injunction of the ban will be heard by a judge in New York Supreme Court on October 18, but the ban is on hold at least until a judge rules on the litigation."It is undeniable that the vaping industry is using flavored e-cigarettes to get young people hooked on potentially dangerous and deadly products.
