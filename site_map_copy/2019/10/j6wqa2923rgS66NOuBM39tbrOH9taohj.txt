(CNN) Threats from a tropical storm have delayed the implosion of the two cranes at the Hard Rock Hotel in New Orleans, which partially collapsed during construction, officials said.Crews had hoped to take the cranes down Friday evening, but that has been moved to Saturday afternoon, said New Orleans Fire Chief Tim McConnell."The wind is our biggest problem," he said.
