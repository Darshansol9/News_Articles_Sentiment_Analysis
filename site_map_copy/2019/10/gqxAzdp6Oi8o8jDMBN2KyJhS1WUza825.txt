(CNN) A memorial sign marking Emmett Till's death that was riddled with bullet holes earlier this year was rededicated Saturday -- this time with bulletproof glass.Patrick Weems, executive director of the Emmett Till Memorial Commission, said more than 100 people, including members of Till's family from Chicago, attended a ceremony near Sumner, Mississippi, rededicating the new and improved sign. Weems said the sign, which cost more than $10,000, weighs more than 500 pounds and is surrounded by security cameras.The sign marks the spot where Till's body was pulled from the Tallahatchie River in 1955. The 14-year-old African American was tortured and killed by two white men after accusations that he flirted with a white woman, and his death became an important catalyst in the civil rights movement.In July, three white University of Mississippi students were suspended from the Kappa Alpha fraternity after they posed with guns in front of the sign, sparking a Department of Justice investigation. The sign appeared to be riddled with bullet holes in the photo, which was first published by the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting and ProPublicaThe first sign went up along the river in 2007 and was stolen the following year.
