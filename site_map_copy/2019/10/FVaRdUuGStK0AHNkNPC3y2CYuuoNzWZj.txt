(CNN) The Michelin Man could send you to college if you can prove you're a responsible driver. All it takes is a penny.The tire manufacturer is giving away $100,000 toward college tuition in its "Penny for a Free Ride" contest. One lucky young driver will win for inspecting their tires -- either gauging tire pressure or performing the "penny tread test" to check tread depth.The penny test is simple: Drivers insert a penny into the groove of a tire with Lincoln's head upside down, facing them. If they can still see all of his head, that means the tread depth is low, and the driver should consider changing their tires.How to enterThe contest, open to drivers between ages 15 and 21, runs October 22 through December 3.
