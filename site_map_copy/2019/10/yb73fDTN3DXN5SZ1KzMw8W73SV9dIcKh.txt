Natasha ChenA woman who had friends and family injured and killed overnight in the Kansas City shooting is pleading for the suspects to turn themselves in.Toni Maciel says the community is very tight-knit, and many people likely know both victims and suspects.“Turn yourself in -- yourselves in. Make it easier for yourselves. Find it in your hearts to do this, please. We have brothers, sons, cousins, uncles, that are no longer here because of your senseless act," Maciel said.Kansas City Police are searching for two possible suspects.A vigil for the victims is scheduled for 7 p.m. CT tonight.Maciel claimed one of the suspects was kicked out of the Tequila KC Bar last night and returned with a second person, resulting in a confrontation and shooting. She described the bar as being a gathering place for the community, always safe and welcoming to adults from their 20s to their 60s. People would come after work for a drink, and guests generally know each other and each other’s families, Maciel said.
