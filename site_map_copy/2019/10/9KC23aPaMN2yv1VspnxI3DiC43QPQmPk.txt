"This is just another fact of this generation seeing the importance of getting trees in the ground to help the future of the earth," he said.Every tree matters! I know I've been posting all the big donations but the small ones are just as important! WE WILL HIT 20,000,000! :)) pic.twitter.com/D72cg1qaxn — MrBeast (@MrBeastYT) October 30, 2019
