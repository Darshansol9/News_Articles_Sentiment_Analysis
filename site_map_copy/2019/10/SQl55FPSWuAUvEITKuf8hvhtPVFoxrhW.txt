(CNN) Deandre Somerville was selected to serve on a civil jury in August. But when he overslept for the trial, he had to spend 10 days in jail â€” despite not having a criminal record.The 21-year-old from West Palm Beach, Florida, was summoned for a hearing in court last month. A circuit court judge asked Somerville why he didn't show up to the civil trial for which he had been sworn in as a juror."I just said, 'Sir, honestly I overslept, and I didn't understand the seriousness of this.' He asked me if I had a criminal record. I said, 'Sir, I've never been arrested,'" Somerville told CNN affiliate WPTVJudge John Kastrenakis found Somerville in direct contempt of court, documents show. Somerville didn't contact the court to explain his absence, the judge wrote in a court order, and his failure to show up delayed the trial for 45 minutes.The judge originally sentenced Somerville to 10 days in jail, 150 hours of community service, a written apology of at least 100 words, a year of probation and $233 in fees, according to court records.Read More
