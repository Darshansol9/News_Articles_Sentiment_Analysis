A Chicago elementary school made a 9-year-old boy leave the building coatless and in short sleeves following a pattern of abuse, according to a lawsuit filed in a US district court in Illinois. Chicago Public School spokesperson Emily Bolton said the security involved has been fired and the principal's actions are being investigated.
