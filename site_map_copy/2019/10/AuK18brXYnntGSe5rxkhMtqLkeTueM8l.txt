A high school principal in Boca Raton, Florida, was fired as a result of emails he allegedly sent to a student's parent in April 2018 that appeared to cast doubt on the historical truth of the Holocaust. The district said there's "just cause" for firing the former principal, based on ethical misconduct and failure to carry out job responsibilities. The man said, through his attorney, that he "believes the Holocaust is factual."
