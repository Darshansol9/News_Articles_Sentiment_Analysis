About five minutes later, the crew reported an issue with the plane and asked to return, NTSB member Jennifer Homendy told reporters."N93012 would like to return to the field," one pilot told air traffic control, according to audio recorded by the website LiveATC.net."What is the reason for coming back?" the controller asked."You got No. 4 engine. We'd like to return, and blow it out," another pilot in the aircraft said.A pilot said he needed to land immediately, and the control tower diverted other jets that were about to land, the recording indicates.The plane hit the instrument landing system posts and veered to the right. It crossed a grassy area, then a taxiway, and ran into the de-icing facility, Homendy said.According to our pilot a plane crash on the runway in Hartford has closed the airport and has everyone scrambling. pic.twitter.com/khAGbq50z5 — Aaron Katzman (@aaron_katzman) October 2, 2019NTSB investigators expect to issue a preliminary report about the crash in about 10 days, and finish the investigation within 18 months, Homendy said.The crash closed Bradley for a few hours, forcing 39 flight cancellations and 19 delays, said Kevin Dillon, executive director of the Connecticut Airport Authority.
