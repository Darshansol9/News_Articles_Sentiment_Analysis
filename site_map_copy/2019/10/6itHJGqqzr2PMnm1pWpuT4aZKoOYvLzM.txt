(CNN) A former high school principal in Boca Raton, Florida, was fired on Wednesday as a result of emails he sent to a student's parent in April 2018 that appeared to cast doubt on the historical truth of the Holocaust.The Palm Beach County School Board voted 5-2 to terminate William Latson's employment effective on November 21, according to records from the meeting posted online.According to the district, there's "just cause" for firing the former principal, based on ethical misconduct and failure to carry out job responsibilities.After a parent emailed Latson in April to ask him how the school teaches students about the Holocaust, Latson responded, "I can't say the Holocaust is a factual, historical event because I am not in a position to do so as a district employee."The school district also specifically criticized Latson for being slow to respond to school district officials during the week after his comments came to light.Read More
