(CNN) More than 30,000 Chicago Public Schools teachers and support staff will go on strike if they can't successfully negotiate a contract deal with the district by October 17, the Chicago Teachers Union said in a statement.The statement late Wednesday quoted several union members."We don't want to strike, but we will if we have to," said special education teacher Linda Perales."Our students deserve smaller class sizes. They deserve nurses. They deserve social workers. They deserve bilingual educators," Perales said. "This is what we're asking for at the table, and we're willing to strike to get them for our students."The union pointed to large class sizes, low pay for teaching assistants and a shortage of counselors, social workers and school nurses, making teachers' work harder than it already is.
