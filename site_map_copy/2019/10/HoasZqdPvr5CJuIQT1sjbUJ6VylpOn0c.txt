ISISYesterday morning, Donald Trump surprised the nation when he revealed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi died in a raid conducted by the US military in Syria on Saturday. During a news conference at the White House, Trump said Baghdadi "blew himself up" when cornered by US forces who conducted a daring, two-hour nighttime raid on his compound in northern Syria. Baghdadi's death marks the end of a years-long hunt to find one of the most wanted terrorists in the world and the man who declared a so-called Islamic caliphate in Iraq and Syria in 2014. It's also the most significant announcement of the death of a terror leader since the announcement of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden's death in 2011. World leaders weighed in on the news, with most agreeing Baghdadi's death was a significant blow to the terrorist organization2. Essex truck tragedyWe're learning more about the circumstances surrounding the deaths of 39 people in a shipping container found last week in Essex, in southeast England. British investigators are still trying to determine the identities and nationalities of the eight women and 31 men in the container, which was on the back of a truck. Each person was carrying a bag of personal belongings and many had mobile phones, which are being downloaded and forensically analyzed. At first, authorities said the victims may have been Chinese, but that assumption was thrown into question when at least one of the passengers was found to be Vietnamese. Now, the incident is believed to be a fatal example of a smuggling operation in which people from Vietnam pay to be transported illegally -- and often in dangerous conditions -- to Europe for a chance at a better life. A 25-year-old man, who was the driver of the truck, has been arrested and charged with manslaughter.3. ProtestsJUST WATCHED No end in sight for Lebanon anti-government protests Replay More Videos ...
