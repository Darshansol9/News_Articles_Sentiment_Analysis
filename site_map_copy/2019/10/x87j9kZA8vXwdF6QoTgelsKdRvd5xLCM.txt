(CNN) The last woolly mammoths roamed the Earth as recently as 4,000 years ago, on a remote island in the Arctic Ocean.Learning about what led to their extinction could potentially save existing species from a similar fate, researchers said.Those mammoths outlived other members of their species by avoiding the environmental factors that led to their extinction, according to a study published in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews . They might've even lived longer, if short-term events hadn't tainted their water and drained their food supply.Mammoths once roamed the entire northern hemisphere, researchers said. But when the last ice age ended and global warming followed 15,000 years ago, shrinking ice and rising sea levels isolated populations.Some of the newly formed groups died as a result. Others survived another 10,000 years before finally succumbing.Read More
