Wind gusts of hurricane force -- at least 74 mph -- were reported at a weather station about 7 miles north of Simi Valley.The newly formed Easy Fire quickly consumed 1,300 acres in Ventura County, officials said. It threatened 6,500 homes and forced school closures and evacuations, including one at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library , where a few staff stayed behind to protect what they can. The former President and his wife, Nancy, are buried at the site."We feel safe," library spokeswoman Melissa Giller said.The Easy Fire burns near the Ronald Regan Presidential Library.The blaze burned on all sides of the library complex but the buildings were not in imminent danger, according to Chad Cook, an assistant chief with the Ventura County Fire Department. But the area was still hot and not immediately in the clear, he said.Heavy winds "are a major concern to us," Ventura County Fire Capt. Brian McGrath told CNN affiliate KABC.About 26,000 people were forced from their homes by the Simi Valley fire, Sheriff Bill Ayub told reporters.

"We are just outside the evacuation zone but are packed and ready to go if things change."Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the state had secured a Fire Management Assistance Grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to help fight the Easy Fire. The grant allows affected local and state and agencies to apply for a 75% reimbursement of eligible fire suppression costs.Strong Santa Ana winds could linger into ThursdayHours after the Easy Fire began, yet another blaze erupted in the city of Jurupa Valley, east of Los Angeles, according to Cal Fire. Known as the Hill Fire, it burned across 50 acres and led to the mandatory evacuations and the shutdown of Highway 60.Hurricane-force wind gusts of 74 mph were also reported Wednesday at a weather station in the mountains outside of Malibu, according to the National Weather Service. Dozens of stations across southern parts of the state reported gusts of more than 50 mph, with relative humidity lower than 10% -- factors helping to fuel the blazes.The Getty Fire scorched 745 acres and was 27% contained, Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Ralph Terrazas told reporters. "Please keep in mind that the Getty Fire is still an active fire and we are not out of danger," said Fire Capt. Jaime Moore said.Fierce Santa Ana winds could last through Thursday, the National Weather Service said.The blaze was likely caused by a tree branch that broke off from high winds and landed on nearby power lines, sparking and igniting nearby brush, the Los Angeles Fire Department said.An extreme red flag warning went into effect Tuesday night and will last through Thursday evening. It's the first time the weather service has issued such a warning to convey potentially historic fire conditions.At least 26 million people are under some kind of red-flag warning.'We're ready to go and say goodbye to our home'Brigitte Kouba Neves, a Los Angeles native, says her heart stopped when her neighbor knocked on her door early Monday and told her they were in the evacuation zone."I can't explain the feeling of packing a bag with the items I want to save from a fire," she said in an Instagram post describing how she and her husband chose daily essentials and their wedding album.Neves lives in a voluntary evacuation zone. So far, she's been safe, but that could change at any moment."Currently, we have our suitcases by the door, the car is packed, and we're ready to go and say goodbye to our home if they say we must," she wrote. But she told CNN what's it's like to live under constant threat and worry."I have 3-year-old twins with sensitive lungs, so school has been canceled a lot, they've had to wear masks, and we've discussed the fact that there are fires far away ... and it changes air quality," she said. "We've let them role play with their firefighter outfits and trucks."California's biggest fire is far from containedacross Sonoma County and more than 180 structures, including 86 single-family homes, officials said. North of the San Francisco Bay, the week-old Kincade Fire -- the state's largest active wildfire -- has destroyed nearly 77,000 acresacross Sonoma County and more than 180 structures, including 86 single-family homes, officials said.It was only 30% contained on Wednesday.

"So we want people to be vigilant, be aware communication may not be great."PG&E slashes power to more CaliforniansPacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) cut off power to about 1 million customers in Northern California earlier this week in an attempt to prevent wildfires. But as hundreds of thousands started getting their power back, PG&E started another shutoff.About 73% of the customers impacted by the shutoff earlier this week had power restored by early Wednesday, PG&E said. But the company also said it would begin cutting off power to 540,000 customers ahead of stronger winds.Each "customer" can mean a home or a business, so the number of people affected is much higher than the number of customers.After a request by Newsom, PG&E announced Tuesday it would be issuing credit to customers impacted by the October 9 power shutoff, which turned off the lights for about 738,000 customers.The utility on Wednesday issued an "all clear" for nearly all areas affected by the shutoff except for Kern County. The order allows utility workers to inspect power lines and equipment before restoring power.PG&E said about 365,000 customers remained without power.From left, Gov. Gavin Newsom, Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Bonin and Mayor Eric Garcetti tour a burned home Tuesday.In Southern California, more than 304,100 faced a possible power shutoff, Southern California Edison said.And even those not in high-risk areas could still lose power.
