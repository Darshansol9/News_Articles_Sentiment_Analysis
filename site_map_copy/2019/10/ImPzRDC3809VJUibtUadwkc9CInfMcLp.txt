(CNN) Mourners packed the pews of a Birmingham, Alabama, church Sunday for the funeral of Kamille "Cupcake" McKinney, the girl who was kidnapped from an outdoor birthday party before her body was dumped in a landfill.Purple and pink flowers and balloons adorned Kamille's tiny casket at the 3-year-old's "homegoing service" at New Beginning Christian Ministry. Colorful cupcakes and an artistic rendering of little Kamille sat alongside the white casket.The girl's uncle, Steven Long, reminisced about the soft voice she used when she called for "Uncle Steve."

Wilson said he had struggled to come up with a message to share with the congregation. His own granddaughter had just celebrated her third birthday, Wilson said.Read More
