(CNN) Sentencing former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger to 10 years for the fatal shooting of her neighbor, Botham Jean, was one of the hardest things jurors ever had to do, two of them told ABC's "Good Morning America."Ultimately, after hearing about Jean's forgiving nature, they couldn't bring themselves to sentence Guyger to the full 28 years behind bars that prosecutors asked for."There's no way we could ever know what he would want," one of them, a white man, said in an interview that aired Friday morning.
