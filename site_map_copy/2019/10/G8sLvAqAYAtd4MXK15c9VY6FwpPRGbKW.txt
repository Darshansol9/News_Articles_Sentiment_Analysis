His guilty plea was the result of an August arrest and charge of trafficking illegal drugs.After a lab report showed a negative test for drugs, he withdrew his plea, court records show. On Thursday, an Oklahoma County judge approved the request, leading to a dismissal the next day, according to The Oklahoman.Gregg, 26, told the judge that the powered milk was from a food pantry, according to the paper.
