(CNN) After a search of an apartment complex did not reveal new information about a missing 3-year-old girl, the police chief in Birmingham, Alabama, made an impassioned plea Wednesday for whoever took the girl to return her safely.Birmingham Police Chief Patrick Smith appealed directly to anyone who knows the location of Kamille "Cupcake" McKinney . She vanished Saturday night from a birthday party at the Birmingham housing complex where her family lives."We believe that you know where she is and we believe that someone has her," he said. "Please bring this to a safe end and place her back into the arms of her family."He urged whoever has the girl to bring her to a police station, fire station or hospital, saying he wanted to give the person "safe passage."Speaking at an evening press conference, the chief announced that a reward in the case has increased to $20,000. The reward, offered by Crime Stoppers of Metro Alabama, is for whoever provided information that assisted police in solving the crime. It is separate from a $5,000 reward offered by Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, which is contingent on providing information that leads to an arrest and conviction in the case.Read More
