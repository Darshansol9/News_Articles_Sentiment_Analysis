(CNN) Students at a Montana elementary school were evacuated on Tuesday when someone found what was initially thought to be a homemade bomb on a playground.Officials later said the suspicious object at Rossiter Elementary School was not an improvised explosive device, or IED, and didn't explode, as was initially reported.

It was left there by a transient with mental health issues who thought he was picking up litter," the department said.Classes at Rossiter were canceled while authorities started an investigation, but the school will now be open Wednesday.
