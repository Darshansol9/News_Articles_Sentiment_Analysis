It’s not clear if this was done.At one point in one of their conversations Caplan says, "It’s just, to be honest, I’m not worried about the moral issue here. I’m worried about the, if she’s caught doing that, you know, she’s finished."At another point, Caplan inquired with regards to changing the location of the test to the West Hollywood Test Center and asked whether anyone had “ever gotten in trouble with this?”Caplan at various points asks if there have been any issues in the past.Caplan and Singer discuss what score Caplan would like his daughter to get on the exam.The court paperwork documents wire transfers Caplan made to a Boston bank account in the name of KWF which, unbeknownst to Caplan, Singer opened at the direction of law enforcement.CNN has reached out to several people at Willkie Farr and Gordon himself and has not heard back.According to authorities Caplan has made his initial appearance in District of Connecticut and was released on $500,000 bond.One of his attorneys, Peter Cane, declined to comment by phone Wednesday.
