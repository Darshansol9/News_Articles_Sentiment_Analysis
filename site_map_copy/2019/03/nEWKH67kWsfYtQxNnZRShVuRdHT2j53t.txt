(CNN) Hollywood moviemakers may have to rethink their intergalactic tactics as new scientific research suggests blowing up asteroids on a collision course with Earth may be trickier than previously believed.According to researchers from Johns Hopkins Universit y and the University of Maryland, asteroids are considerably tougher and require a greater force of energy to destroy them than scientists had calculated.The conclusion was reached after simulating the collision of two asteroids: a target asteroid, with a diameter of 16 miles (25 kilometers), and a smaller asteroid with a diameter of under a mile, which struck the target at a velocity of three miles per second.The experiment suggested that instead of the small asteroid shattering the larger one, as previous experiments predicted, the large asteroid remained relatively undamaged."We used to believe that the larger the object, the more easily it would break, because bigger objects are more likely to have flaws," Charles El Mir, an author of the study and a researcher with the Whiting School of Engineering at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said in a statement . "Our findings, however, show that asteroids are stronger than we used to think and require more energy to be completely shattered."Read More
