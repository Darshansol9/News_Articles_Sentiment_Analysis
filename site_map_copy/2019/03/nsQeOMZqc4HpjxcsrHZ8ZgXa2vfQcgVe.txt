(CNN) The parents of Kate Steinle, who was shot and killed in July 2015 by an undocumented immigrant, cannot sue San Francisco for refusing to tell immigration officials of the shooter's release from local custody a few months before the killing, a federal appeals court ruled Monday.In a wrongful death lawsuit, Steinle's parents had argued that San Francisco and its former sheriff were partly to blame for their daughter's death, because officials failed to notify Immigration and Customs Enforcement when Jose Ines Garcia Zarate was released from jail.Garcia Zarate, an undocumented immigrant and repeat felon from Mexico who'd been deported five times prior to the shooting, was released from custody in April 2015.On Monday, a panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's 2017 dismissal of the family's claims."As the main opinion properly acknowledges, the events underlying this case are tragic," the court filing states.
