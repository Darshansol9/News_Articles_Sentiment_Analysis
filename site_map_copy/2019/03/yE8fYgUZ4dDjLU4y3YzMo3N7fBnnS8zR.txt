(CNN) After a package bomb killed a California day spa owner last May, investigators arrested her business partner and ex-boyfriend Stephen Beal and accused him of possessing an unregistered destructive device.The charge was dropped two weeks later. But on Sunday, after a 9-month follow-up investigation, authorities arrested Beal again and charged him with carrying out the fatal bombing as part of a targeted attack against his former girlfriend."This was a horrific intentional attack that killed an innocent woman and severely injured two others who will live with the physical and emotional scars for the rest of their lives," US Attorney Nick Hanna said in a statement.The powerful package bomb blew out the windows and walls of the Magyar Kozmetika day spa in Aliso Viejo, California, Hanna said in a press conference on Monday.
