(CNN) New York terror suspect Sayfullo Saipov was surveilled for three years, right up until the eve of the deadly attack he stands accused of carrying out. Now, he wants access to what the government knows, according to a motion filed Monday in the Southern District of New York."The government revealed it had been surveilling Mr. Saipov and two of his associates for years, recording his conversations with them to gather information about his personal contacts, professional experiences, finances, and potential exposure to ISIS propaganda, violent jihadism, and Islamic extremism," Saipov's attorney Andrew Dalak argued in the heavily redacted filing.Dalak wrote the government must disclose details of the surveillance and any materials pertaining to his client's alleged connection to ISIS, so the legal team can mount a defense.Saipov is facing the death penalty after being accused of running down pedestrians with a truck on New York's West Side bike path on Halloween 2017, killing eight people. He has been charged with 28 counts, including eight counts of murder, 18 counts of attempted murder, and other terrorism charges.
