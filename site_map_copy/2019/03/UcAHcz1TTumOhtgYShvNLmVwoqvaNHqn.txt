Sacramento, California (CNN) Frustrated residents packed into Sacramento's City Hall Tuesday to condemn the police response to a Monday night protest and decry the California attorney general's decision to not bring charges against the officers who shot Stephon Clark, an unarmed black man, last year.The AG's move continued a week of disappointment for Clark's supporters after Sacramento County on Saturday also declined to bring charges.An overflow crowd launched into chants of Clark's name and, occasionally, shouted down council members as they vented their anger. The protest came nearly a year after two police officers shot and killed Clark in his grandmother's backyard.The meeting stopped for about 20 minutes at one point and council members left the chambers after a speaker climbed onto a table.Several speakers at the meeting said that police officers were overzealous in arresting 84 people Monday as they protested the district attorney's decision not to press charges against the officers in Clark's death.
