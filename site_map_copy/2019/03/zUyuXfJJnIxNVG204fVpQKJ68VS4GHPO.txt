(CNN) The family of a northern California rapper who lawyers say was shot more than two dozen times by police intends to sue the city of Vallejo, alleging the police response was "bungled from start to finish."Willie McCoy, 20, was fatally shot February 9 after apparently falling asleep in the front seat of a car at the drive-through of a Taco Bell in the San Francisco Bay area. Police said six officers later opened fire after McCoy appeared to reach for a gun in his lap."You all executed my brother Willie," McCoy's sister, Simone Richard, told reporters this week at a news conference where lawyers said the shooting was part of a disturbing series of questionable shootings, excessive force and racial profiling involving the Vallejo Police Department. "You all didn't give him a chance to put his hands up."The family's wrongful death claim against the city -- filed Thursday as a precursor to a lawsuit -- said some responding officers were not wearing uniforms and that a "six person firing squad" shot McCoy about 25 times in the "head, ear, neck, chest, arms, shoulders, hands, and back.""From our point of view we think ... that something is rotten within the Vallejo Police Department," said attorney John Burris, who claimed his office has been involved in at least 14 cases against the police department in the last seven years.Read More
