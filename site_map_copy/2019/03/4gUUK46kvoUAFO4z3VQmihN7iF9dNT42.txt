New York (CNN) Authorities at the Port of New York and New Jersey have seized about 3,200 pounds of cocaine in what authorities are calling the largest cocaine seizure at the port in nearly 25 years, and the second largest of all time.The drugs were found aboard a shipping container that entered the US from Buenaventura, Colombia, last month and have an estimated street value of $77 million.The cocaine was discovered in packages placed for easy removal from container.The drugs were discovered at the port of Newark after authorities detected an irregularity in the pin used to close the shipping container doors, according to Special Agent Erin Mulvey with the New York division of the US Drug Enforcement Administration. "It was the pin that indicated something was off," Mulvey told CNN.Authorities opened the shipping container to discover 60 packages containing a white powdery substance that later field-tested positive for cocaine.Mulvey said a legitimate shipment of dried fruit was behind the packages and that the drugs were likely loaded near a set of doors so as to be easily accessible to smugglers. The ship was headed next to the Belgian city of Antwerp.Read More
