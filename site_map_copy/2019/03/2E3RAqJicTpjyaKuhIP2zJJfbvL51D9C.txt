(CNN) A day care worker in Missouri was charged Thursday with child abuse after she was captured on a surveillance video throwing a 3-year-old girl into furniture last month, police said.The North County Police Cooperative identified the former employee as Wilma Brown, 27. A felony warrant has been issued for Brown's arrest after the incident on February 1 at Brighter Day Care and Preschool in Pine Lawn, outside St. Louis, police said.Wilma Brown, 27, has been charged with abuse of a child.Brown, who in the day care's surveillance video appears to grab the child, wrote that the child suffered a "bump on her head" after falling on the carpet, according to a copy of the unintentional injury form provided by the family's attorney, Jennifer Hansen.The toddler was treated at a hospital for a gash in the middle of her forehead and swelling in her face. She received seven stitches, then was readmitted two days later after the wound became infected, Hansen said. The family grew concerned after the child's medical issues seemed to be more serious than initially reported, and asked to see the day care's surveillance footage.On February 5, the family watched the footage with the day care's director, Hansen said. Brown was subsequently fired, according to Hansen and Timothy J. Smith, an attorney representing the day care.Read More
