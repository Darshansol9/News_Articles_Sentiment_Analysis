The economic output lost since the referendum is worth about 800 million pounds ($1 billion) per week, or 4.7 million pounds ($6 million) per hour.And with UK politics in disarray, there's still a risk the country will leave the European Union without a transitional deal to protect trade, known as a no-deal Brexit.The fallout from that scenario would be worse than the 2008 financial crisis, according to the Bank of England.
