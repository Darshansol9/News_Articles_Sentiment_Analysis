(CNN) A Tennessee state house panel voted today to advance a business anti-discrimination bill that advocacy groups fear would further an anti-LGBT agenda in the state.HB 563 cleared the state's House Commerce Committee 11-5 and seeks to stop state and local governments from taking "discriminatory action against a business based on the policies of the business" in areas including health insurance, family leave policies, or anti-discrimination policies.During the hearing, the bill's sponsor, Rep.
