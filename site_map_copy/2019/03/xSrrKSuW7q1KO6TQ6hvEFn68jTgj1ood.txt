(CNN) Kevin Spacey's sex abuse case returned to a Massachusetts court Monday as his defense team worked to obtain cell phone records and other evidence from the actor's accuser.The hearing, which Spacey did not attend, focused largely on procedural issues with the discovery of records in the case. Spacey's defense is seeking credit card records, employment records and bookkeeping records from The Club Car, the Nantucket bar and restaurant. Spacey, 59, is accused of groping a busboy on a July 2016 evening at the bar.The busboy, 18 at the time of the alleged assault, came forward to report Spacey more than a year later, telling police he did not want Spacey to victimize others, according to a criminal complaint.
