The man who has been taken into custody in connection with the shooting death of the reputed New York crime boss Francesco "Frank" Cali, will waive extradition, his lawyer told CNN. Suspect Anthony Comello will be formally charged with murder when he's extradited to the borough of Staten Island, where the killing happened, NYPD Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea said. Cali's killing does not appear to be mob related, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN.
