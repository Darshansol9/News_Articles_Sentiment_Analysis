The night before, police 100 miles south in Indiana found her car abandoned in a ditch off busy Interstate 94.Sapp, who has been nominated for eight Grammys, filed a personal protection order against her, in which he complains that Patrick "has claimed him as her husband, had moved from California to Michigan, joined his church, had contacted his children and had been to his home."I have at least 400 pages of correspondence from her which I have never responded," his complaint reads.Patrick's family recognized that questions have arisen regarding the missing woman's mental health, but said the focus must remain on finding her.JUST WATCHED Videos show doctor who disappeared Replay More Videos ...

But the videos have an intimate feel to them."Hi, baby," Patrick says in one. "I am just coming to you to say 'hi' and tell you about my day."In another video, Patrick shows a table set for two with omelets and pancakes."If you were here, this is what would be your plate," she coos.The two videos were posted in early November.A third video to surface came from a local hotel in Kalamazoo. That's where Patrick went the night of December 5, just hours before police found her car in the ditch in Indiana.At a little past 7:30 p.m., Patrick, dressed all in black, showed up at a Radisson hotel not far from the hospital where she worked.She spent around 10 minutes talking with employees at the reception desk but ultimately left.There's no audio on the video, and it's not clear why Patrick failed to book a room.But at 7:48 p.m., she strode across the hotel's tiled floors, out the door and onto a hotel shuttle bus.Those images provide the last known picture of Patrick.Her family says Patrick, who had just moved to Michigan, bought a plane ticket to come visit them for the holidays in Florida.Her colleagues called her "part of our family of medical professionals."Investigators have said they have no evidence of foul play, but they also don't have conclusive evidence that Patrick's movements on December 5 were voluntary.Police brought out dogs to track Patrick's scent. They led investigators the 30 or so feet out of the ditch where Patrick's car rested to the highway. There, the trace went cold.
