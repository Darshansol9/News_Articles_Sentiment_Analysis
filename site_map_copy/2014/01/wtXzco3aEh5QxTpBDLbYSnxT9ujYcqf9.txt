"This is viewed as something where woman are seized in their own countries, they're blackmailed and held in captivity. This is a crime with a lot of victims. We are approaching these cases now by identifying the woman as victims, not perpetrators."Intercepted conversations involving the ring revealed that it used various code names for cocaine, including "party," "jewelry," "powder," "maek" and "Soojaebi," a Korean noodle and vegetable soup, the statement said. The prostitutes delivered the cocaine to the customers in what was referred to as a "party pack."The enterprise allegedly generated millions of dollars in illegal proceeds and planned to target high-end clientele coming to the New York area for the Super Bowl this weekend.The 11-month investigation involved undercover investigators, physical and electronic surveillance and reviews of business records, the statement said. The attorney general's Organized Crime Task Force and the New York Police found that the criminal enterprise spanned Manhattan, Brooklyn, Long Island, Queens and several states. The operation was based in Manhattan.Customers were charged for sex and drugs as a package deal, "sometimes billing for cocaine in an equivalent number of 'hours' of prostitution," the statement said.The ring commonly supplied customers with large quantities of drugs to get them impaired, authorities said. Then the room would be flooded with additional prostitutes, and the customer's credit cards would be charged, at times upward of $10,000 for one night. Through front businesses, the ring would charge credit cards for goods and services not actually provided in order to hide the purchases of cocaine and sex.Most of the 18 suspects were arrested but some were still being sought. Those charged with various felony and misdemeanor counts were identified as Tony Yoo, 34; Jopseh Landrum, 32; Hyun Ok Yoon, 41; Young Ok, 38; Kyung Chun Min, 33; Sun Lee Ahn, 56; Young Mi Lee, 40; Ji Young Moon, 40; Janice Lee, 35; Hee Jung Chern, 42; Haiming Quan, 41; Kyong Bin Cho, 44; Jung Hee Jang, 43; In Suk Cho, 49; Ji Young Lee, 34; Hada Jang, 26; Nina Kim, 31; Hajoung Heath, 40.
