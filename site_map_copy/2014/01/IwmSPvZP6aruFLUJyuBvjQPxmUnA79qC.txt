State Department security personnel will be accompanying athletes to every single event, every single venue."....It is to make sure we have eyes on the teams and eyes on the events," another senior State Department official said.The officials did not say how many U.S. security officials would be on the ground with the U.S. Olympic team in Sochi, but the number is likely to be considerable given there are more than 230 athletes and 270 coaches and other U.S. officials.That doesn't take into account the roughly 10,000 U.S. citizens, according to State Department estimates, who are expected to attend the Games as spectators.Even as the State Department officials said there was "no specific Sochi Olympic evacuation plan that we are ready to just pull off," Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel appeared to indicate there was a plan of some sort."We've had conversations with the Russian government on protection of our citizens," Hagel told reporters."... If we need to extract our citizens, we will have appropriate arrangements with the Russians to do that."Russia has not asked the United States for "any specific assistance or technology," Hagel said.The United States is moving two warships into the Black Sea, Hagel said."We want to help. But right now there has been no request from the Russian government for any particular assistance."
