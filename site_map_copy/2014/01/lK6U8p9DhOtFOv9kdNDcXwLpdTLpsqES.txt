Story highlights Man died of multiple gunshot woundsSheriff's office releases photo of unique belt, buckleAuthorities hope someone will see it and offer fresh cluesAuthorities in Wyoming are hoping that a unique belt and buckle will help solve a murder mystery.The Park County Sheriff's Office released a photo of the belt, which was found on the headless body of a man who died of multiple gunshot wounds.Because the man was decapitated, authorities are having a tough time trying to identify him.They hope someone will recognize the belt and offer fresh clues.The design of the belt and buckle has been identified as similar to "piteado," a type of craftsmanship common to some parts of Mexico and Guatemala, read a statement from the sheriff's office."This is not to say that the victim was from those regions," said Sheriff Scott Steward. "It is simply a design native to those areas. It would be irresponsible of us to eliminate any possibilities at this stage."Over the weekend, deputies and specially-trained dogs searched in and around the crime scene to locate the missing body parts. They found no new evidence.According to the final report from the forensic pathologist, the dismemberment occurred post-mortem."However we're still unsure if the killing was done at the scene of the discovery or somewhere else, even outside our jurisdiction. We simply do not sufficient evidence to make that determination," the sheriff said.
