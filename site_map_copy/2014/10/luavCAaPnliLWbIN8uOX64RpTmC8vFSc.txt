Another four homes and three buildings suffered damage.There were fears that things could have gotten worse. The flames threatened about 1,000 homes and another 100 commercial buildings, spurring large-scale evacuations in Carrick and Weed, which is about 50 miles south of the Oregon border.Authorities threw significant resources at the wildfire -- using over 1,000 firefighters, 100 engines, 28 bulldozers and five helicopters -- to bring the blaze under control.As all this was going on, law enforcement was trying to figure out how it started. And throughout, according to Weed police, Marshall was "a person of interest."Police presented the case to the Siskiyou County District Attorney's Office this week for review, and a judge later issued a warrant for his arrest.
