"I didn't even know where Marion County was."DiBella made the trek to Florida this week to pick Nika up from a family friend who has been caring for her.When CNN asked how his little pup could've made her way from New York to Florida, DiBella replied, "I have no idea."Maybe the dog just wanted to be a snowbird.But one thing is for sure -- Nika's is quite a tail to tell.
