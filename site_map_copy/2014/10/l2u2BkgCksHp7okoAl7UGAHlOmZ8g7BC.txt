A Jewish fraternity at Atlanta's Emory University was spray painted with swastikas Sunday morning -- shortly after the end of one of the holiest days in Judaism.The university said campus police are investigating and have stepped up patrols after the incident at the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity house.The swastikas and other graffiti were discovered early Sunday morning, hours after the end of Yom Kippur, or the day of atonement."Among the many pernicious things the swastika symbolizes, in the last century it represented the most egregious and determined undermining of intellectual freedom and truth-seeking," Emory President Jim Wagner said. "In short, its appearance on our campus is an attack against everything for which Emory stands."Last month, someone drew swastikas inside the campus library.The fraternity has been a fixture at Emory since 1920.
