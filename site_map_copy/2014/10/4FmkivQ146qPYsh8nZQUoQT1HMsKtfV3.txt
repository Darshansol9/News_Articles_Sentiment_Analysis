The New York Police Department said in a memo: "Police Officers on patrol should maintain a heightened level of awareness."The attack in Washington occurred around 3 a.m. as the officer was sitting in his marked squad car in Washington's Brookland neighborhood, near the campus of Catholic University of America, police said.The officer, who hasn't been identified, wasn't injured by the ax, but he chased the suspect and suffered a shoulder injury in a scuffle before the attacker ran away, police said. No motive is known and the suspect remains at large. Police said he was an African-American man about 6 feet tall and of stocky build.JUST WATCHED D.C. cop atacked with ax Replay More Videos ...
