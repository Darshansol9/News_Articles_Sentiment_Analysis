Story highlights U.S. will ease restrictions on defense sales related to maritime securityThe United States has previously maintained a full arms embargo on VietnamThe policy shift follows aggressive Chinese drilling efforts in disputed seasThe United States will ease some restrictions on defense sales to Vietnam, the State Department announced Thursday, following a meeting between Secretary of State John Kerry and his Vietnamese counterpart.While this change is limited to maritime security-related sales, it is a significant step forward for the U.S.-Vietnamese relationship. The United States previously maintained a full arms embargo on the country, which started during the Vietnam War nearly 40 years ago.During his meeting with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh, Kerry emphasized that any change to defense cooperation will be tied to Vietnam's human rights record, according to State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki."Our security relationship remains under constant review," Psaki said in a news briefing. "Clearly, there's more work that needs to be done in areas like human rights, and that's one thing that the secretary conveyed during the meeting. And this is, of course, a partial lifting."The Vietnamese have been pressing the United States to lift its arms embargo, particularly following aggressive acts by China in the disputed the South China Sea.JUST WATCHED Vietnam ambassador on dispute with China Replay More Videos ...
