Los Angeles (CNN) -- One of the suspects in a California shooting spree that left two sheriff's deputies dead was deported to Mexico twice, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Authorities say Marcelo Marquez, 34, of Salt Lake City, Utah, was arrested Friday after police found him in a home in Auburn, about 30 miles from the initial shooting. Also arrested was Jannelle Monroy, 38, of Sacramento County, who was allegedly with Marquez during the rampage, authorities said.The rampage began in the parking lot of a $56-a-night motel outside downtown Sacramento when two sheriff's deputies checked on a suspicious car there.Authorities said by the time the spree was over on Friday, the suspects had killed two sheriff's deputies in two counties, wounded a third deputy, attempted three car carjackings and shot a driver in the head -- all during a span of six hours.
