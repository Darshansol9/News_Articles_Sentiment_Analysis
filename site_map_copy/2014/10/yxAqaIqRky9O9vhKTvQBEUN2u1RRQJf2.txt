(CNN) -- When Grandma Nelly lays down a challenge, you'd better accept it.And she wasn't shooting low. Nelly was gunning for NBA star Dwyane Wade."Dwyane Wade," she says, pointing her finger at the camera in a YouTube video. "On my 90th birthday, I want to play one-(on)-one with you."On Tuesday, she got her wish.Grandma Nelly -- AKA Illuminada Magtoto -- met Wade at the Heat practice facility for a little shoot-around."I want to play with you," said the grinning grandma who barely came up chest-high to the 6-foot, 4-inch guard. "Now I'm 90."Wade appeared to be just as touched by the encounter."This gives me life. This gives me a purpose," he said after it was over.Wade sealed the date with a kiss on the hand."Oh my God," she squealed."I'm very, very happy. I'm very grateful," Nelly said. "This is my dream come true."
