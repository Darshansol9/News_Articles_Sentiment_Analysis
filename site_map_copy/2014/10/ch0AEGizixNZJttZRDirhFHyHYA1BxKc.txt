The United Nations' health authority projected that deaths from the virus have exceeded 5,000."I think it's outrageous how this child was treated," said Gary Phelan, the attorney for the girl's family. "At some point, making a medical decision has to be based on medical information, not fear."In a statement Wednesday, Milford Schools Superintendent Elizabeth Feser denied that the school's response was improper."In addressing this situation, at all times, my staff and I proceeded in good faith to respond to this public health issue," the statement said. "We acted in the best interest of all of our students and staff."Phelan said the decision to keep Ikeoluwa out of school came after complaints from parents of her classmates.The girl's father, Stephen Opayemi, was told by city officials that if he tried to bring his daughter to school, police would remove her, the lawyer said.Ikeoluwa has not been diagnosed with Ebola and has not exhibited symptoms, the lawsuit said. In addition, the city of Milford refused her father's offer to have himself and his daughter tested for Ebola.'Severe emotional distress' allegedOn October 20, the World Health Organization declared that Nigeria, which is several hundred miles from the epicenter of the outbreak, had contained Ebola after 19 cases, including seven deaths. The declaration came after 42 days with no new Ebola cases reported.The WHO credited an aggressive response by Nigeria's government and effective contact tracing.The lawsuit said a local health official told Ikeoluwa's father that the decision to "quarantine" his daughter at home was "due to the rumors, panic and climate at Meadowside Elementary School."Ikeoluwa "suffered severe emotional distress" from the decision, the lawsuit claims.The girl traveled to Nigeria with her father from October 2 to October 13 to participate in a family wedding. When she returned to the United States, school officials ordered that she remain home for 21 days, until November 3, according to the lawsuit.The suit was filed under the Americans With Disabilities Act.New York incidentJUST WATCHED Dad claims sons bullied over Ebola fear Replay More Videos ...
