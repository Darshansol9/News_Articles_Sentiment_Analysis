Marijuana plants can have anywhere between one and 13 leaflets per leaf, depending on maturity and health, but they generally have seven or nine."It did have quite a number of characteristics that were similar to a cannabis plant," Georgia State Patrol Capt. Kermit Stokes told WSB.Upon realizing that it had dispatched officers to confiscate a popular gumbo ingredient, the Georgia State Patrol, which operates the task force, issued an apology, both to Perry and publicly."If we disturbed them in any manner, that's not our intent. Our intent is to go out and do our job and do it to the best of our ability," Stokes told WSB.It seems like a humorous mistake, only because no one was hurt, but there have been numerous instances in which innocent citizens have been injured or worse when police acted on bogus information.That potentiality didn't escape Perry."The more I thought about it, what could have happened? Anything could have happened," he told WSB.
