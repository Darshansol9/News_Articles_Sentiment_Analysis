"I've lost count after 20 in total. The most on one round-trip stretch was about seven times."He even started wearing his work ID around his neck for easy identification.One concerned citizen is looking to take the target off Tully's back.Dawn DeBiase of East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, started an online fundraiser to help the father of two purchase a car. The campaign has raised more than $22,000 in just five days.DeBiase said she was touched by Tully's plight."He's a good guy. He's working to support his children. He's not in the street boo-hooing because he doesn't have a car; he's walking to work every day."Due to the overwhelming response, DeBiase said, she's closing the fundraiser this week at Tully's request."He doesn't want to be greedy about it, because what's there now will help him," DeBiase said. "He's ready to take it from here."In the meantime, others in the community have stepped up to give him rides to work."He absolutely appreciates everything. He's totally overwhelmed by everything," she said. "He's a very humble, hardworking guy."
