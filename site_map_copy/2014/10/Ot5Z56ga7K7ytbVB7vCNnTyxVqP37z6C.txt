Story highlights "Butte nugget" nets $400K at a San Francisco antique showThe 6-pound gold chunk was discovered in Northern California in JulyBuyer wishes to remain anonymousThe term nugget doesn't quite do it justice.This thing is more like a whopper.A more than 6-pound chunk of gold sold over the weekend for $400,000, according to the San Francisco ChronicleAn anonymous Bay Area buyer snatched up the "Butte nugget" -- named for the Northern California county in which it was discovered this summer -- at the San Francisco Fall Antiques Show.The huge hunk of bullion went on public display Thursday, piquing the interest of hundreds who flocked to the show to get a peek."Nuggets like this don't come along every day," said David McCarthy, the nugget's appraiser. "I really didn't believe that I would see a California nugget of this size unearthed during my lifetime."McCarthy told the Chronicle that the buyer is "a prominent Bay Area collector" who specializes in historical items.A fitting specialty, given that his collection is now one for the history books.And that's a distinction that is worth its weight in gold.
