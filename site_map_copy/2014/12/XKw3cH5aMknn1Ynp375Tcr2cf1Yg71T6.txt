Relatives said he "has never expressed any radicalization," Boyce said.Brinsley's aunt and sister told CNN affiliate WCBS that the family struggled to understand why he was set free after so many run-ins with the law."They kept releasing him into the streets," Jalaa'a Brinsley said, "so isn't that a problem that the justice system should be asking, not us?"Authorities are investigating how Brinsley got the gun he used in the attack. A man purchased the handgun at a Georgia pawn shop in 1996, when Brinsley was 9.Investigators said Brinsley's mother described her son as "very often violent," following "a very troubled childhood." He had tried to commit suicide, she told them, according to Boyce.
