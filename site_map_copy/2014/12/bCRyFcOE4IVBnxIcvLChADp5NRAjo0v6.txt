In New York City, the Patrolman's Benevolent Association sent a form for members to sign and return to their PBA delegate requesting the mayor not attend their funeral if the officer is killed in the line of duty because of the mayor's "consistent refusal to show police officers the support and respect they deserve."The city replied with a statement, saying: "This is deeply disappointing.
