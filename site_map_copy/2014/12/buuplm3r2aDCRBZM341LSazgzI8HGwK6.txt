MUST WATCH Murderer of two homeless men on the loose 01:09"A lot of our shootings involve robbery. A lot of our shootings involve someone making good on an old debt or some kind of revenge factor," Atlanta police Detective David Quinn told reporters earlier this week."I don't know why someone would shoot two defenseless men."The shootings happened during Thanksgiving week, within three days of each other.Three days, 3 miles apartIn the homeless men case, the first shooting took place November 23.Dorian Jenkins, 42, was fatally shot five times as he slept, wrapped in a blanket, on a sidewalk in downtown Atlanta.Less than three days later, Tommy Mims, 64, didn't show up as normal at a recycling center where he took cans and other scrap metals to sell.Mims, known locally as "Can Man" was found dead under a bridge where he usually slept. His body, also wrapped in a blanket, had seven gunshot wounds. He was killed less than three miles from Jenkins."They never came out of the sleep they were already in," Quinn said. "They weren't fleeing, running. They were asleep when they took these rounds."Telling detailsPolice say evidence links the killings of the homeless men.The rounds used in both shootings are fairly distinctive: .45-caliber bullets that, according to Quinn, haven't been made since 2010.They were fired from revolvers, either a Taurus "Judge" or a Smith & Wesson "Governor." That reveals another troubling fact."These guns have a capacity of five or six rounds," Quinn said. But Mims, the second victim, had been shot seven times."Someone had to reload the gun in order to get seven rounds in him."
