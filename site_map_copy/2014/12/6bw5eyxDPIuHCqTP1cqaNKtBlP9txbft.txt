"The unavoidable reason is humanitarian."Four of the former detainees -- Ahmed Adnan Ahjam, Ali Hussain Shaabaan, Omar Mahmoud Faraj, and Jihad Diyab -- are Syrian nationals, while Abdul Bin Mohammed Abis Ourgy is Tunisian, and Mohammed Tahanmatan is Palestinian, Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said Sunday.Canal 10 reported that the United Nations refugee agency will be responsible for returning the released prisoners to their homes.Their transfers to Uruguay were unanimously approved by the United States' Guantanamo Review Task Force, which represents six departments and agencies.The review was prompted by an executive order issued by President Barack Obama shortly after his inauguration in January 2009.Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel informed Congress of the intent to transfer the six men, the Defense Department said.Saturday's transfers leave only 136 detainees at Guantanamo Bay, out of more than 750.That's the lowest number of inmates at the base in Cuba since detainees started arriving in 2002.At least seven detainees have died in custody over the years.In Mujica's open letter, he also called for the United States to lift its embargo on Cuba and release some Cubans and Puerto Ricans he called political prisoners.
