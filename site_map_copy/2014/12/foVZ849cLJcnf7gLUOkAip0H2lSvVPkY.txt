Story highlights Two Yemenis and three Tunisians transferredGuantanamo Bay has held nearly 800 detaineesThe U.S. government has transferred five more Guantanamo Bay detainees, shrinking the number to 127.The detainees, two Yemeni and three Tunisians, were repatriated to Kazakhstan, after the Guantanamo Review Task Force said it determined the men did not pose security threats.The Defense Department identified the men as Asim Thabit Abdullah Al-Khalaqi, Muhammad Ali Husayn Khanayna, Sabri Muhammad Ibrahim Al Qurashi, Adel Al-Hakeemy, and Abdullah Bin Ali Al-Lufti.The move advances President Barack Obama's goal of drawing down the number of those held at the U.S. naval base in southeastern Cuba, something that has been ongoing for years.JUST WATCHED Graham on North Korea and Guantanamo Bay Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH McCain offers hope that Gitmo could be closed 01:29The administration of then-President George W. Bush claimed that, since Gitmo detainees weren't held on American soil, they could be considered " enemy combatants " and be denied some legal protections. Almost all of the nearly 800 detainees were held without charges.This legal limbo, as well as allegations of torture and other mistreatment, spurred criticism of Gitmo. Shortly after his 2009 inauguration, President Barack Obama signed an executive order to close the detention facility within a year.That didn't happen.One reason was because of strong opposition from lawmakers, many of them Republicans, who cited the risk of freeing men who had fought to kill Americans.About 17% of the 620 Gitmo detainees released -- most of them during Bush's presidency -- went on to engage in terrorist activities, a September semiannual report from the director of national intelligence found. Another 12% are suspected of having engaged in terrorist or insurgent activities.
