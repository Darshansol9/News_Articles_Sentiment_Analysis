In the meteorological world, this is referred to as an inversion when the temperature actually warms with height (as opposed to it cooling with a rise in altitude)."Van Dam said though cloud inversions are a treat for the eyes, they are hardly unprecedented.The clouds as seen from Mather Point."However, when it produces this short-lived, almost ethereal event, it sure has many people's attention."The video of the cloud inversion condensed 15 minutes into one minute, according to the park.It "almost looks like a tide coming in and going out," it said in a post.The canyon is 277 miles (446 km) long, nearly 18 miles (29 km) wide and a mile (1.6 km) deep.The park was established in 1919 and gets about 5 million visitors a year.
