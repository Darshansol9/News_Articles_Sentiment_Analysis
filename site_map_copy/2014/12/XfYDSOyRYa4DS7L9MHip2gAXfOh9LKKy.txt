The suspension could be longer if there are "possible mitigating or aggravating circumstances."Goodell called the enhanced policy "significantly more robust, thorough and formal." It applies to all NFL personnel, not just players.JUST WATCHED Rice PR campaign 'not good' for Goodell Replay More Videos ...

"There is no guarantee that economic support will be there for as long as it takes for a victim to get back on her feet, and no indication that the NFL even understands that a six-game unpaid suspension could spark even higher level of violence."A new conduct committee will include Cardinals owner Michael Bidwell, Falcons owner Arthur Blank, Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, Bears owner George McCaskey and Texans owner Robert McNair. Other members are Dee Haslam, the wife of Browns owner Jimmy Haslam; Cowboys Executive Vice President Charlotte Jones Anderson and two former players who hold ownership stakes -- Warrick Dunn and John Stallworth.Their job will be to review the policy at least once a year.
