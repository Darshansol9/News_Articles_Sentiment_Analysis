While other girls have played in the World Series, none have gotten the same attention as the South Philadelphia resident and Taney Dragons standout.The 13-year-old became a national sensation after tossing a shutout -- giving up three hits and notching six strikeouts in the process -- to help Taney become one of the final 16 World Series contenders.Mo'ne persistently deflected attention to her teammates -- all of them boys -- even as the media consistently made her the headline. She recalled how she happened into baseball after a coach spotted her tossing a football, how her stellar play caught some off-guard and how she interacts with her teammates.One would expect, then, that this will all die down.

The accompanying story says Mo'ne's first love is basketball and her dream is to play for legendary coach Geno Auriemma's University of Connecticut team.Elliott Hughes-Taylor doesn't doubt Mo'ne can do it, saying she "completely dominated the Philly league (despite) every play matching up with 6-foot-2, 6-3 boys.""Everyone's seen her pitch," Hughes-Taylor, Mo'ne's coach in soccer, told SI. "Well, I promise you, she's five times better at basketball."
