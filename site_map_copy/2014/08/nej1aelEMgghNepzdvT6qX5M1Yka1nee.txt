Story highlights This week's episode of "The Sixties" explores the Vietnam WarU.S. involvement escalated in the '60sLBJ: "A man can fight if he can see daylight ... but there ain't no daylight in Vietnam"The Vietnam War began in the decade before, but the conflict, and especially U.S. involvement, escalated in the 1960s. For the first time, Americans witnessed the horrors of war, played out on television screens in their living rooms.This week's episode of "The Sixties" explores the war and its impact on American culture, then and now. Here are five facts from the episode that may surprise those too young to remember the Vietnam War:1. U.S. involvement in Vietnam began with Eisenhower.In the late 1950s, during the Eisenhower administration, Vietnam had split into North Vietnam, which was communist, and South Vietnam. Cold War anxieties dictated that if the North Vietnamese communists prevailed, the rest of Southeast Asia would fall like dominoes.When he took office in 1961, President John F. Kennedy vowed not to allow South Vietnam fall to communism.2. The United States and South Vietnam had Catholic presidents who were shot to death in November 1963.JUST WATCHED The Sixties: How music shaped a decade Replay More Videos ...

In addition, By the early 1960s,South Vietnam's conventionally trained army was no match for the Vietcong's guerrilla-style tactics.In addition, South Vietnam's Buddhist majority revolted against their president, Ngo Dinh Diem. They saw the Catholic ruler as a tyrant.The Western-educated Diem, however, wielded absolute power and rose to dictator level by the summer of 1963. The CIA discussed toppling the regime.With U.S. knowledge, Diem was killed by South Vietnamese generals on November 2, 1963. Kennedy immediately regretted Diem's death and U.S. support for the coup.Less than three weeks later, on November 22, Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson took the oath of office aboard Air Force One later that day. Soon after, Johnson told a grieving nation, "John Kennedy's death commands what his life conveyed, that America must move forward."3. TV forever changed the way Americans viewed warAs casualties rose, the country increasingly turned against the war. The official line was that Americans were winning in Vietnam, but the evening news told a different story."What Vietnam did to America via television was introduce us to a new kind of America," said author Lawrence Wright. "One that was not pure, one that committed the same kinds of atrocities that are always committed in war, but we had never allowed ourselves to see them."Reporter Morley Safer recalled the shock of witnessing Marines burn down 150 houses on the outskirts of the village of Cam Ne. An officer told the newsman that he had been ordered to level the area. Three women were wounded in the attack, one baby was killed, and four people were taken prisoner.Safer asked a soldier if he had regrets about leaving people homeless, and the soldier replied, "You can't expect to do your job and feel pity for these people."Another soldier told Safer, "I think it's sad in a way, but I don't think there's any other way you can get around it in this kind of a war."Americans back home were stunned when the CBS report about the Cam Ne village hit the news.After the broadcast, Johnson reportedly called then-CBS president, Frank Stanton, and said, "Frank, this is your President, your boys just s--t on the flag of the United States."4. Some Americans resorted to self-mutilation to avoid the draft.Photos: 60 iconic moments from the 1960s Photos: 60 iconic moments from the 1960s 60 iconic moments from the 1960s – Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll defined the 1960s.
