Story highlights "Project Horizon" proposed a leap beyond the Soviets in the space raceThe U.S. Army said a military base on the moon was a "requirement"Military officials considered the detonation of a nuclear device near the moonThe military outpost was to have bulldozers, cabins, nuclear power plantsThe U.S. military races to the moon to build a base -- to beat the Russians to the punch. Maybe test a nuclear weapon on the surface. Consider a lunar-based bombing system to target earthbound foes.That was the plan in the 1960s, according to declassified national security documents released this week -- some of them stamped as "SECRET."But consider this:Currently, a vision of sending humans to Mars has begun to form in our collective imagination. Technological advances are swelling our anticipation of touching that dream in a decade or two.JUST WATCHED U.S. spending $1.2B to snag asteroid Replay More Videos ...

The space around the Earth and moon would be considered a military theater.Lunar nuclear power plantsAfter a thorough justification of the scientific, political and military need for the base, the proposal -- two documents and more than 400 typewritten pages -- calculated out the details of what could be done on the outpost and what it would take to make it reality.It offered graphs and mathematical formulas; considerations for low gravity and magnetic field, lack of water and air, and ballistic dynamics on the moon's surface; and design drawings of spacecraft, lunar bulldozers, modular moon cabins and special space suits.JUST WATCHED Imagine finding Earth 2.0 Replay More Videos ...

Page after page was dedicated to the future capabilities of the Saturn rockets that would boost the supplies there.With expansion would come lunar nuclear power plants.Construction of the basic outpost would start in 1964 and be completed five years later.The visions were a bit ahead of schedule. Humans did not land on the moon for the first time until July 1969. And in the end, it wasn't the military, but NASA that sent them there.Lunar nuclear detonationThe nuclear arms race was omnipresent in the '60s, and Project Horizon made room for its possible expansion to the moon. It pondered the pros and cons -- scientifically, militarily and psychologically -- of detonating a nuclear device on the moon or nearby.And it reflected on the possibility of using nuclear weapons in space.Technological advances accelerated the Cold War and the space race through the 1960s, and U.S. military and intelligence agencies expounded in further papers on how the moon could be used for military purposes or intelligence gathering.The U.S. agencies also documented their space rivalry with the Soviet Union, how U.S. intelligence picked up Soviet anti-ballistic missile radar images, when their signals reflected off the moon.Intelligence officers feverishly studied Soviet space capabilities and intercepted pictures their spacecraft signaled back to Earth.And in 1967 the CIA documented how operatives "borrowed" a Lunik space capsule, analyzed it and returned it to the Soviets.The purpose of a nuclear detonation near or on the moon would be for show, a document said.Its "foremost intent was to impress the world with the prowess of the United States."The security archive said that Air Force leaders scrapped the idea after deciding that it was too risky.
