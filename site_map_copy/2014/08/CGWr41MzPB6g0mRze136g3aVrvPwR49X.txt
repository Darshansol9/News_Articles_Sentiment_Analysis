There's nothing for him here in Chicago."According to the police report, the shooting happened about 7 a.m. Saturday. The 20-year-old man was standing outside when shots were fired from a white vehicle that passed by.

The police report states the shooting may have been gang-related.The executive producers and directors of the series said this is part of the reality that many young people in Chicago live every day."Lee Jr. and other kids are growing up in a culture of hopelessness and despair, where there is a seemingly endless supply of guns," said Mark Levin, co-director of "Chicagoland.""It's very disheartening to hear that Lee Jr. was shot. I'm relieved to hear he's out of the hospital and recovering," he said."This is just what Principal Dozier and others fear -- you stick around in a war zone and you get hurt."
