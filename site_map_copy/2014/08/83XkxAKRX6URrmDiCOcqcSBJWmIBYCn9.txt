"They're jelly-like creatures, but they're not exactly jellyfish."Also known as "by-the-wind sailors," the creatures have a clear, distinctive fin sticking up from a blue, oval body no larger than the palm of a hand."Every now and then, the currents and the winds will change and these guys will, instead of being pushed out to sea, they actually wind up on the beach," Bader told CNN.They first started showing up in Washington and Oregon, and by mid-July reached San Francisco.
