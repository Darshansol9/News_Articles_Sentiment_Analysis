"That might be what we're doing through the next few days."The police officerWilson, 28, who has six years on the force with no disciplinary issues on his record, is on paid administrative leave, authorities said.Whether he'll return to duty is uncertain. He would have to undergo two psychological evaluations first, authorities said.Law officials have described Wilson as "very shaken." He was briefly taken to the hospital following the confrontation with Brown for treatment of an injury that left his face swollen, according to Jackson."He's devastated. He never intended for this to happen," Jackson said. "He was a gentleman. A quiet officer. He is and has been an excellent police officer."Michael Brown's familyThey've hired lawyers and expressed outrage at how the police have handled things, including Friday's simultaneous release of the officer's name and surveillance video from the day of the shooting that showed a man identified in police documents as Brown roughing up a convenience store clerk while purportedly stealing cigars.The family and critics of the department have accused police of trying to damage Brown's character. Jackson said he released both the officer's name and the video because the media requested it.The family has conceded their son wasn't "a perfect kid," said family attorney Daryl Parks.The family and their attorneys, however, took strong exception to the department's actions.A convenience store surveillance video purports to show Michael Brown before he was fatally shot by police."Michael Brown's family is beyond outraged at the devious way the police chief has chosen to disseminate piecemeal information in a manner intended to assassinate the character of their son, following such a brutal assassination of his person in broad daylight," the family and their attorneys said in a statement."There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender," the statement said.What about the community?Schools in Ferguson and two nearby districts -- Jennings and Riverview Gardens -- remained closed due to the ongoing violence, CNN affiliate KMOV reported Monday.With all the chaos, businesses have also been affected. More looting was reported overnight in the adjacent city of Dellwood. Several businesses have been ransacked, some burned."I know that people are upset, but is this the justice for Mike Brown?" the owner of a looted store asked KMOV. The station showed bullet holes in the store's facade, broken windows and destruction inside."All the small businesses, now they're running them out, and then people will complain later on and say there are no businesses in their neighborhood," the owner said. "I can't survive like this."
