He was deeply affected by it and that's why as band director he did everything he could to stop anything inappropriate," he said.The attorney said Waters "left the band with a far improved culture from the one that he inherited," and slammed the report that ousted him."Had (investigators) chosen to talk with a representative sample of students and alumni, rather than its hand-picked, isolated sample, its conclusions would have been far different," he said.The university responded Tuesday."The former director has yet to produce any factual examples that demonstrate any tangible attempts to change the band culture," said Gary Lewis, an Ohio State spokesman. "In fact, the former director himself acknowledged that he knew of the nicknames both as a student member of the band and as its director."But Waters said "the university found no tangible evidence of cultural change because it conveniently chose not to look."Ohio State also appointed two interim band leaders Tuesday.
