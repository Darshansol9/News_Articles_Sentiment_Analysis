The lead car appeared to have climbed an escalator adjacent to the passenger platform."I've investigated many accidents and trains do different things," National Transportation Safety Board investigator Tim DePaepe told reporters. "It's all about kinetic force. I have not seen an accident like this personally."NTSB experts will examine video from station cameras and one on the front of the train for clues to the cause of the crash, DePaepe said.JUST WATCHED Train derails, slams into platform Replay More Videos ...
