Taikwok Yung, a self-described "domainer" developed four websites -- trumpmumbai.com, trumpindia.com, trumpbeijing.com, and trumpbudhabi.com -- parodying the well-known businessman and providing commentary, often disparaging, on Trump and his television shows "The Apprentice" and "The Celebrity Apprentice."Attorneys representing Trump filed a countersuit against Yung, 34, at the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn in March 2013, seeking damages for "federal cybersquatting."That's defined by the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act as "the registration as domain names of well-known trademarks by non-trademark holders who then try to sell the names back to the trademark owners."Trump was seeking the maximum damages allowable -- $100,000 for each of the four Trump-related domain names.Attorney James Weinberger told CNN the ruling "should serve as a deterrent to Mr. Yung or anyone else who thinks they can register names that include Trump's trademark and name and use them for commercial purposes."JUST WATCHED Trump on his wallet, phone and politics Replay More Videos ...
