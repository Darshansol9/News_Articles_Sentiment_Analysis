"They won't find any. But they will find body parts" of runaways and individuals she described as bad people in Big Lake and Mexico Beach. She told the paper she dumped a body off Interstate 95 in Raleigh but gave no other details.Her lawyer, Edward Greco, told CNN on Sunday he had no comment.In the recent interview, Barbour told the Daily Item that two other men responded to her ad for companionship but never showed up to meet her."I tried it a few times, but it never worked out," Miranda Barbour told the Daily Item, referring to the couple's plan to kill someone together. "I knew we were going to do this since the day we met, and we tried, but the others just didn't show up."
