Some pedestrians in San Francisco's Financial District were treated to an extra shower Friday morning.A broken valve in a sprinkler system, first reported at 9:27 a.m., unleashed a waterfall from a 12-story office building at Market and Kearny streets, according to CNN affiliate KTVU . Water spewed from the top floor, cascading down the side of the building and onto the pavement.The building is, among other things, home to Hakkasan, a posh and modern Chinese restaurant chain. It was not harmed in the downpour, nor were any unsuspecting morning commuters.
