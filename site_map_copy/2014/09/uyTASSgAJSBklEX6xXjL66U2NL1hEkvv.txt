They got off and left behind their deadly devices.Spanish courts later convicted 14 Islamist militants for their roles in the bombings, along with four Spaniards for trafficking in explosives used in the attacks.On July 7, 2005, 52 people were killed and 700 injured when four bombers planted explosives on three underground trains and a bus in London.In 2005, 52 people were killed and 700 injured when bombers planted explosives in London.The bombers, from the north of England, used cheap explosives and techniques found on the Internet to carry out the country's worst terror attack.British intelligence came under criticism after reports that the country had received reliable warnings about such an attack.Two weeks after the London transit bombings, an attempted second wave of bombings struck other trains and a bus, but the devices failed to explode properly. More than a dozen people were arrested afterward.Four homemade bombs stuffed into backpacks did not fully explode in the attempt. One person was injured.In 2012, a Bosnian immigrant accused of plotting to bomb New York's subway system as an "al Qaeda terrorist" was found guilty of conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, conspiracy to commit murder, supporting a foreign terrorist organization and other charges.Prosecutors said Adis Medunjanin traveled to Pakistan's tribal region with two high school friends, Pakistani-born Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay, an immigrant from Afghanistan. His friends pleaded guilty to planning the attack with with Medunjanin and testified against him.Medunjanin sought to join the Taliban, but ended up being recruited by al Qaeda to perform a suicide mission in the United States. On their return, Medunjanin and his two friends hatched a plan to rig backpacks with explosives and blow them up, prosecutors said.At trial, Assistant U.S. Attorney Berit Berger said Medunjanin was willing "to strap a suicide bomb to himself, walk into a New York City subway and blow it up."
