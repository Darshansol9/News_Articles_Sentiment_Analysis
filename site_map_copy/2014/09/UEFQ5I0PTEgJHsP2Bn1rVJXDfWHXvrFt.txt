"It was pretty scary at points."Seven helicopters, a plane and ground teams spent the afternoon battling the fire, which is in an area at an elevation of 7,000 feet, park authorities said.The cause of the blaze is still under investigation. No injuries or damage to structures have been reported.Authorities have said that California's ongoing historic drought has helped fuel the fires in the area.
