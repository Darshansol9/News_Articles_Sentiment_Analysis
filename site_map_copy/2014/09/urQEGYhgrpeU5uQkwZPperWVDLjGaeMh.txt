Officials in Louisiana found evidence of a deadly brain-eating amoeba in a town's water supply. Neighbors are nervous, though St. John the Baptist Parish officials say the water is safe to drink, bathe in and cook with, and the danger comes from inhaling it through your nose. Now, a state emergency order requires the parish to increase chlorine levels for 60 days to kill the deadly amoeba. Affiliate WWL reports.
