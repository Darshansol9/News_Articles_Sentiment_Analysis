Each charge is punishable by five years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.The indictments allege Neely asked the GSA to pay for two trips to Las Vegas as well as trips to Long Beach and Cambria, California, knowing they weren't for business purposes. He's also being prosecuted for an allegedly false travel voucher filed for roundtrip airfare between Guam and Saipan.During 2012 hearings, members of Congress sharply criticized the GSA for lax oversight of billions of dollars in contracts and called for the agency to clean house as it roots out corruption.Neely cited his Fifth Amendment rights and refused to testify.The scandal came to light when a GSA inspector released a report shedding light on the Las Vegas conference as well as violations of travel and spending rules.Among other details, the report explained how Neely, and presumably others , avoided strictures against supplying food at government work conferences such as the Las Vegas event by creating joke awards in order to hold ceremonies at which food would be allowed.It was not clear from the indictment what occurs next in the case, or what Neely's status was on Thursday. Neely is expected to make his first court appearance on October 20.
