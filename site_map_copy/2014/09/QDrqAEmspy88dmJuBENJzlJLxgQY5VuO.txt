Dozier School for Boys identified through a DNA match, USF said in a press release issued Thursday.

According to USF, a death certificate said Thomas died of pneumonia 34 days after being admitted.His body was found very close to the body of George Owen Smith , the first student whose remains were identified, USF said. Thomas's remains were positively matched with DNA from his brother, Richard Varnadoe, USF said.Four students killed Earl Wilson, 12, a few days after he arrived at the school in August 1944, USF said. Medical evidence presented at the trial of the students listed the cause of death as blunt force trauma to the head, USF said. Results of the trial were not included in the press release.Wilson was positively matched with DNA collected from his sister, Cherry Wilson, USF said.His body was found in an area of the school grounds where crosses were placed in the 1990s, though the crosses didn't reflect the location of the graves or the number of children buried."Our ability to provide answers and the physical remains of those who died to their brothers and sisters after more than 70 years is a remarkable privilege," said Erin Kimmerle, lead researcher and USF associate professor of anthropology, "We recognize the need to help families and victims find resolution, no matter how many decades pass."
