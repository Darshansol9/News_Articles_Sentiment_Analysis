"Buddy system!"Others argued for Realtors to carry guns while showing homes. Others favored pepper spray or other deterrents."This is always a fear I've had," Nancy Israel Valene wrote. "I am praying you find Beverly. She is me, she is you, and she is the entire Realtor community nationwide. Who could have imagined that this is a dangerous job? Not me."
