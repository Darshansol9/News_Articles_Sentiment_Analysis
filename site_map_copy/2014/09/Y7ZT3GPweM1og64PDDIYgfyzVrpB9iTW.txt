The statement did not say that his departure was connected to Rivers' death and clinic spokeswoman Marcia Horowitz declined to elaborate.In a statement, the Manhattan clinic said that the cardiac arrest did not happen during her elective procedure, and, responding to reports of a biopsy, said: "A biopsy of the vocal cords has never been performed at Yorkville Endoscopy."Many questions have been raised about what treatment was given and what might have gone wrong that led to the comedian's death.

"The type of sedation used at Yorkville Endoscopy is monitored anesthesia care. Our anesthesiologists utilize light to moderate sedation."Only licensed medical doctors who are board-certified anesthesiologists administer anesthesia at the clinic, the statement said."Our anesthesiologists monitor the patient continuously utilizing state-of-the-art monitoring equipment, and remain at the bedside throughout the procedure and into recovery," it said.The clinic statement also deflected criticism that Rivers should have been treated in a hospital and not a clinic because of her advanced age."Yorkville Endoscopy has strict policies in place for the criteria of who gets treated in this center versus in a hospital," the statement said. "Every patient is pre-screened by their gastroenterologist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse for appropriateness to be treated at Yorkville Endoscopy. Some patients are also pre-screened by their personal physicians."
