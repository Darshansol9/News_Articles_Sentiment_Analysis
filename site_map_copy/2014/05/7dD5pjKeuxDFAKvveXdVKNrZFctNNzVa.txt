Jim Cravener, a firefighter with the North-West Fire Protection District in Park County, said, "(The notes) were hard to make it out. One of them appeared to say 'Please help doors won't open.' Another one (said) 'Please help, bleeding, need a doctor' and another one said, 'Six days, no food, no water, please help.'"Cravener said Hopkins was "really severely dehydrated."The man who spotted the car had stopped to take photos at the top of a pass near a sharp curve, Cravener said."He ventured off the highway a little bit, found the vehicle, and walked down to it," the firefighter said. "The person thought they found a body."Cravener and another firefighter were surprised to discover Hopkins alive.The car was upside down in a heavily wooded and steep area. As the other firefighter went to break a window, Hopkins put her hand on the glass.Hopkins went in and out of consciousness, Cravener said."She said she crashed at night," he said. "We assumed she crashed the night before, but it turned out it had been several days."The family asked for privacy during Hopkins' recovery."While we are hopeful for her prognosis, Kristin was seriously injured with multiple internal and external injuries," Willie said.Hopkins lives in Highlands Ranch, about 90 minutes away from the accident scene.
