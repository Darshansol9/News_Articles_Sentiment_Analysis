He then began his search for his biological father, whom both had not contacted since Stewart was abandoned.The vice president of a cleaning company in the capital of Louisiana recounted his decade-long search for his biological father, which ended with the discovery that Best was the serial killer.During the search, Stewart, who is married with a child, kept a journal that became the basis for the book, "The Most Dangerous Animal of All."A chilling wanted posterAt one point during his search, he was watching television when a 1969 "Wanted" poster from the San Francisco Police Department flashed on the screen."And my heart stops. And I think I let out an audible scream, noise," he said.His son rushed into the room, his eyes transfixed to the television."And he says hey, Dad, it's you. And I walked back to my office ... where I had the only photo I've ever had of my father, which I was told was an old DMV photo. But it turned out to be his 1962 mug shot for his rape of my mother. And I said, 'No, son, it's not me. It's my father.' "Revealing initialsStewart said he reached his conclusion after years of research, including forensic experts comparing notes from the killer with his dad's handwriting on his marriage certificate. He said he also discovered his father's initials in cryptograms or ciphers the killer sent to newspapers."The Zodiac Killer insisted to the police ... if you crack the cipher, you'll have my identity," Stewart said.They did, and they found the initials, but they still didn't know whom they belonged to, he said.The San Francisco Police Department said it will investigate the revelation -- the latest person claiming links to the killer."It's an open and active case, so we don't comment," police spokesman Albie Esparza said this week."But (it's) certainly something our homicide investigators will take a look at."Many past claimsStewart is the latest in a series of people to make the claim that they descended from the famed Zodiac Killer.There's the self-proclaimed "Stepson of the Zodiac Killer," Dennis Kaufman, who has appeared on TV news and a crime show touting his deceased stepfather Jack Tarrance as the crazed killer. He said his stepfather's handwriting was similar to the killer's.There's Steve Hodel, who says his father was a columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle -- the paper to which the Zodiac Killer sent his mocking notes. His claim, too, was discounted.Whether Stewart's contention will hold true is yet to be seen.
