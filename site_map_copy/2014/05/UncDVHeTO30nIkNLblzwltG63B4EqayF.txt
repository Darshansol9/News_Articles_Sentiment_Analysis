Story highlights Heisman Trophy winner said he forgot to pay, police sayPolice: Jameis Winston ordered crab legs, crawfish and left without payingWinston is suspended from FSU's baseball teamHe was not arrested, but received a citationFlorida State University quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Jameis Winston was cited for allegedly taking seafood from a Tallahassee grocery store without paying, the Leon County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday.Winston, a two-sport athlete, was suspended from FSU's baseball team on Wednesday.Winston, only the second freshman to win college football's most coveted award, allegedly walked into a Publix near the FSU campus Tuesday night, ordered about $32 worth of crab legs and crawfish, and walked out of the store without paying, sheriff's Maj. Michael Wood told reporters.After deputies contacted him about three hours later, Winston told them that he forgot to pay, Wood said."He was very cooperative," Wood said. "Seemed fairly honest in the fact that he did not pay for the items, so it was not a huge mystery to solve."As part of the civil citation for alleged shoplifting -- an alternative to criminal prosecution for first-time, nonviolent offenses in the county -- Winston was not arrested but has been ordered to serve at least 20 hours of community service, Wood said.CNN's call to the university's athletic department was not immediately returned.JUST WATCHED Duke Rape Case Revisited Replay More Videos ...

Publix and Winston agreed to this citation, Wood said.He said the sheriff's office has issued 32 civil citations "for very similar crimes" since December.Winston won the Heisman in December, a month after a Florida prosecutor announced no charges would be filed over a woman's allegation that Winston raped her in 2012.
