Forget cats in trees. Oregon firefighters rescued a 600-pound bull from a riverbank this week.Firefighters with Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue (TVF&R) were called to help after the prize-winning bull, Patrick, fell down a steep embankment and got stuck.The bull's owner reportedly told firefighters the bull was friendly -- and indeed he was. Images released by TVF&R show firefighter Blake Reichel cozying up to the creature.Firefighters decided to take the bull back up the way he came down, tying a rope to his harness, CNN affiliate KPTV reported."We just continued to pull and push him up there, and as soon as he saw light -- and figured he was close to home -- he really started going," Reichel told the affiliate.According to a statement from TVF&R, Patrick kept calm during the Wednesday rescue, which lasted about an hour. The bull was not injured."It's not a very frequent call," Reichel said, KPTV reported. "It's amazing. Every day we do the job, nothing's ever the same."
