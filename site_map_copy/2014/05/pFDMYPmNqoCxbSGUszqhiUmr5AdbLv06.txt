It can carry a prison sentence of up to two years.Worthy spokeswoman Maria Miller said the adults are scheduled to go to trial in August and the juvenile in June. She said that there was not sufficient evidence to charge the other suspects with ethnic intimidation, but that the case remains open and the investigation ongoing.A Change.org petition demanding that Moreno charge Utash's assailants with a hate crime had 124 signatures Sunday morning.
