Police and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating.Norm Hyde, spokesman for festival host Meadow Event Park, said Federal Aviation Administration inspectors were on site Friday, checking balloons and safety records before the balloons took off.All the balloons' safety records were up to date, he said.Weather conditions are one of the elements investigators are looking at, NTSB air safety investigator Heidi Moats said.There was no inclement weather at the time and, so far, officials don't believe those conditions played a role in the crash, Geller said over the weekend.Thirteen hot air balloons had been soaring on the eve of the Mid-Atlantic Balloon Festival in Doswell, and three were landing close to each other. Two landed safely, Geller said, but as the third balloon descended, it hit a power line, sparking a fire that spread quickly.The pilot began doing his safety maneuvers and "took every step to manage the situation," Geller said. But then there was an explosion, and the basket and balloon separated.
