"It was not our intention to be disrespectful and we sincerely apologize for the ill-advised references."The apology came after Hugo Balta, the president of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, said in a written statement, "This is simply the worst example I have seen of a discriminatory stereotypical portrayal of any community by any media. The fact that this was done by a news organization is abominable. This wasn't a chance occurrence. This was a planned segment where many decision-makers at MSNBC's 'Way Too Early' program agreed on the content and execution which concluded on what was seen nationwide."Balta added in a Skype interview with CNN en Espa√±ol: "It made me ashamed for the journalists, for this network MSNBC, to show a segment that is full of stereotypes about the Mexican community."JUST WATCHED Cinco de Mayo: What you need to know Replay More Videos ...
