These computer-generated images underscore his spirit of experimentation and his willingness to embrace new media -- qualities which, in many ways, defined his practice from the early 1960s onwards," said Eric Shiner, The Warhol's director.The works were commissioned by the now-defunct Commodore International to showcase the computer's capabilities. They include doodles and experiments with Warhol's iconic images, like the Campbell's soup can.The works might have been lost forever if it had not been for Cory Arcangel, an artist who watched a YouTube clip showing Warhol promoting the release of the Amiga 1000 in 1985.He started to poke around, eventually approaching the museum's chief archivist to talk about the possibility of searching for the files amid The Warhol's archives collection."In the images, we see a mature artist who had spent about 50 years developing a specific hand-to-eye coordination now suddenly grappling with the bizarre new sensation of a mouse in his palm held several inches from the screen," said Matt Wrbican, the archivist.The works have since been extracted and backed up so they can be saved, even if the floppy disks fail."We can only wonder how he would explore and exploit the technologies that are so ubiquitous today," Wrbican said about Warhol.
