Story highlights The Pulitzer Prize for public service is among journalism's highest awardsCoverage of NSA surveillance, based on leaks by Edward Snowden, won this yearThe Washington Post and Guardian US each took the awardThe Boston Globe won in breaking news for reporting on the Boston Marathon bombingTwo news organizations' stories about National Security Agency surveillance, based upon documents leaked by Edward Snowden , have been awarded the Pulitzer Prize for public service, often described as the highest prize in American journalism.The Washington Post and United States arm of The Guardian each received the prize on Monday.The Pulitzers are administered by Columbia University. More than a dozen prizes were announced on Monday, but the recognition of the NSA reporting was most significant because of the questions raised by Snowden's leaks and the reaction to them.The Pulitzer board's decision is bound to be controversial; then again, snubbing the NSA coverage would have been controversial, too.Snowden, who has been living in Russia while seeking asylum from U.S. prosecution, said in a statement that the Pulitzer board's recognition of the coverage was "vindication for everyone who believes that the public has a role in government."JUST WATCHED Stelter: Pulitzer for Snowden coverage?

As even the President has acknowledged this is a conversation we need to have."Other Pulitzer Prize winners included the staff of the Boston Globe, for breaking news reporting in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombings; Chris Hamby of the Center for Public Integrity for investigative reporting; Eli Saslow of The Washington Post for explanatory reporting; and two New York Times photographers, Tyler Hicks and Josh Haner.
