"We want to go back, but due to the current living conditions, we can't go back."The teen -- who has not been publicly identified -- has told investigators that he was trying to get to Somalia to see his mother, and had no clue which plane went where, a law enforcement official told CNN. He is said to have hopped a fence at San Jose International Airport shortly after 1 a.m. on Sunday, the dark of night cloaking his intentions.He stayed on the grounds for six hours without getting caught, a government official said.The boy told authorities that he crawled into the wheel well and lost consciousness when the plane took off. He survived the nearly five-hour flight in subzero temperatures at oxygen-depleted heights as high as 38,000 feet, authorities believe.Discovered after he apparently regained consciousness in Hawaii, the boy has been recovering at a hospital, according to a state health official.He is in the custody of Hawaii Child Welfare Services workers, said Kayla Rosenfeld, spokeswoman for the state's Department of Human Services."He was really soft-spoken and appeared to be tired. His answers were a little slow initially coming out," Maui District Airport Manager Marvin Moniz told CNN affiliate KGO"We did get him some food prior to the paramedics getting here. We asked if he was hungry. He indicated yes, he was. We got him some teriyaki meatballs and rice and a package of cookies and a bottle of water," Moniz said.Once he's ready to go home to California, he'll have access to counselors and psychologists, Santa Clara High School Principal Gregory Shelby told KGOThe teen, who recently transferred to Santa Clara High, is now the talk of the school.Emanuael Golla, a senior, said the boy was extremely shy. He told CNN that he had just arrived within the past few weeks.
