Story highlights Ferrell's college friend Craig Pollard started Cancer for College after twice battling cancer himself'Cancer for College' provides scholarships to current and former cancer patients whose medical bills left little for collegeFerrell played doubles with tennis stars Novak Djokovic and Stand Wawrinka, as well as actor Kevin Spacey, to raise money for the causeBack in 1993, my friend Craig Pollard set out with a very simple mission. He wanted to help cancer survivors realize their dreams of a college education.As a two-time cancer survivor himself, Craig saw first hand how the disease can devastate a family physically, emotionally and financially. Even families with great insurance can exhaust all their resources trying to return their children to good health, leaving little if nothing for that child's continued education.Since inception, Cancer for College has granted over $2 million in scholarships to more than 1,000 survivors from around the country. It's an opportunity for these young people who have had to endure so much to feel like they can return to some kind of normalcy in their lives. All the applicant stories are so inspiring with many of the survivors wanting to go on to become doctors, nurses and counselors. Some even go on to work in the very hospitals where they were treated.JUST WATCHED Will Ferrell: A serious note Replay More Videos ...
