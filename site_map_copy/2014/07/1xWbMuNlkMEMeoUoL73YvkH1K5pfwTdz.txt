He was treated and released after investigators interviewed him.Silverman used a gun he was carrying to shoot Plotts in the arm and torso, authorities said.Plotts was being treated at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.It's unclear why Plotts opened fire, authorities said last week.Whelan told CNN affiliate WPVI, "This could be a much different situation if the perpetrator was allowed to continue with his actions, so I give credit for the staff for intervening."Two guns were recovered at the scene -- Plotts' and Silverman's. It wasn't certain who shot Hunt but, according to Whelan, investigators believe Silverman shot Plotts in self-defense.
