The facility had just gone through a multi-million-dollar renovation two years ago."Unfortunately, Pauley Pavilion took quite a bit of water," Chancellor Gene Block told reporters Tuesday night. "It's painful."At least one outdoor athletic stadium turned into an island of grass surrounded by a sea of murky brown water.But UCLA academic and residence halls were not affected, the university said, and classes will continue Wednesday.A geyser on Sunset BoulevardJust before rush hour Tuesday, the 93-year-old water main burst under the world-famous Sunset Boulevard.The explosion busted through several lanes of the street and sent a geyser of water shooting into the sky. But no one was injured in the ordeal.It's not clear exactly what cause the burst. But it happened at a very bad time for the city and state.Drought-stricken California recently passed statewide water restrictions, and Gov. Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency in January."Unfortunately we lost a lot of water -- around 35,000 gallons a minute -- which is not ideal in the worst drought in the city's history," Los Angeles city councilman Paul Koretz said. "So we ask everybody to try harder to conserve water."
