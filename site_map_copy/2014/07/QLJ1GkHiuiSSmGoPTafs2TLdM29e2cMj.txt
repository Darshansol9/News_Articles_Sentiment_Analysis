Story highlights 230 people were on board TWA Flight 800 from 13 countriesThe government spent four years and millions of dollars in the investigationThe FBI said the disaster was not caused by a terrorist actOn July 17, 1996, TWA Flight 800 took off from JFK Airport headed for Paris. Just 12 minutes later, it exploded over the shores of Long Island, New York. There were 230 people on board, and no one survived.Many eyewitnesses described seeing something heading toward the plane before it exploded, and the suspicion of terrorism was almost instant. The biggest investigation in aviation history, at that time, ensued.Photos: TWA Flight 800 Photos: TWA Flight 800 TWA Flight 800 – Accident investigators said Wednesday, July 2, they would not re-open the probe of the mid-air explosion that brought down TWA 800 nearly 18 years ago on July 26, 1996, killing all aboard. The decision by the National Transportation Safety Board dashed the hopes of a documentary film team claiming to have uncovered "solid proof" that investigators erred in concluding it was an accident.Here, a section of the wing of TWA Flight 800, seen here a couple of days after the crash, floats in the Atlantic Ocean off Long Island, New York.

Hide Caption 10 of 10The government spent four years and millions of dollars in that investigation and 18 years later, many still question whether they got it right.With that in mind, here are five surprising things you probably didn't know about the investigation, including one big thing the investigators themselves still don't know:1. The FBI interviewed at least 755 witnesses.TWA Flight 800 crashed eight miles off the coast of Long Island at dusk on a clear summer night. Hundreds of witnesses saw the plane explode from either on shore, on a boat, in a plane or in at least one case, a helicopter.Of the 755 witness reports that the FBI have made public, accounts vary widely but hundreds describe what they thought was either a flare or fireworks heading up toward the plane before it exploded. A few witnesses even used the words "missile" or "rocket."2. America was in a high state of alert when TWA 800 crashed.A series of terrorism-related events in the years, months and weeks before the flight went down, and even one incident just days afterward, led many to suspect terrorism was to blame.-- December 21, 1988: Pan Am Flight 103 explodes over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 270 people on board. Eventually Libyan national : Pan Am Flight 103 explodes over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 270 people on board.

Two years later, Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of that attack, is arrested in Pakistan by the FBI and the State Department and put on trial. "I am a terrorist and proud of it," he told the court.-- April 19, 1995: The The Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma City is bombed.

Moammar Gadhafi and Saddam Hussein were suspects.Beyond terrorist groups being suspected, state-sponsored terrorism was also cause for concern inside the White House. Leon Panetta, former secretary of Defense and former CIA director, was chief of staff for President Bill Clinton at the time of the crash."The investigation was looking at almost every possibility, including state actors, because we'd known that Libya had been involved with regards to bringing down the airliner over Scotland (Pam Am Flight 103)", said Panetta. "We were looking at Iraq and Saddam Hussein. We were looking at, you know, the possibility of even Iran might have played a role in this," added Panetta.4. It took close to a year, but all 230 victims were eventually recovered.There were 230 people on board TWA Flight 800 from 13 countries. When the plane crashed into the water, much of what was left sunk 130 feet below the surface in the Atlantic Ocean.While it took authorities more than 10 months, remains of every victim were recovered. All of their names are etched into the TWA Flight 800 International Memorial at Smith Point County Park on Long Island, New York. The memorial was dedicated on July 14, 2004, and it includes flags from the 13 countries of the victims.5. The NTSB said a spark in a fuel tank led to the explosionIn November 1997, more than a year after the crash, the FBI announced that a criminal act did not bring down the ill-fated plane. At that point, it was up to the National Transportation Safety Board to figure out the cause of the explosion.
