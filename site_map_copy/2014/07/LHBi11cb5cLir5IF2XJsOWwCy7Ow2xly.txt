Story highlights The lawsuit says school officials ignored repeated attacks by a white studentThe black teen was found dead in January 2013 in a rolled-up mat in his high school gymA sheriff's office investigation ruled the death accidentalAn independent pathologist hired by Johnson's parents ruled it a homicideThe family of Kendrick Johnson filed a wrongful death lawsuit against school officials claiming their lack of action led to his death at the hands of another student.Johnson's body was found in a rolled-up mat in the Lowndes High School gymnasium on January 11, 2013.His parents earlier filed a negligence lawsuit against the south Georgia school district claiming it was negligent and violated Johnson's constitutional right to equal protection based on race. Johnson, 17 when he died, was African-American.The new lawsuit accuses the Lowndes County Board of Education, its superintendent and the high school principal of ignoring reports that Johnson was repeatedly attacked and harassed by a white student."As a direct result of and proximate result of defendants' aforesaid actions and omissions, on or about January 10, 2013, Kendrick Lamar Johnson was violently assaulted, severely injured, suffered great physical pain and mental anguish, and subjected to insult and loss of life, all of which took place at the hands of one or more students while on the property of Lowndes High School and during its normal hours of operations," the lawsuit said.JUST WATCHED E-mail leads to gym-mat death clues Replay More Videos ...

Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson believe that their son was beaten to death. They hired an independent pathologist, who found "unexplained apparent nonaccidental blunt force trauma" to the teen's neck and concluded the death was a homicide.The U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia launched a federal investigation into the case on October 31, 2013.Warren Turner, an attorney for Lowndes County Schools, told CNN the school had not been served with the lawsuit so "it would be premature and inappropriate to make a public comment on this matter at this time."
