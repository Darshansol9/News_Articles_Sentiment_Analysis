I think he was the first rocker ever to stage a fund-raising event, the Concert for Bangladesh."Near the tree stump, a plaque reads "In memory of a great humanitarian who touched the world as an artist, a musician and gardener."Below that it reads, "For the forest to be green, each tree must be green," a quote attributed to Harrison.Harrison, often called the quiet Beatle, died of lung cancer in 2001 in Beverly Hills.In a photo that LaBonge says he took five or six years ago to mark an anniversary of Harrison's passing, the mature tree is ringed by family friends.The picture includes Harrison's widow Olivia, Eric Idle of Monty Python fame and Jeff Lynne, the Electric Light Orchestra frontman who played with Harrison in The Travelling Wilburys.Beatles songs written by Harrison include "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" and "Something."The virtuoso guitar player's signature riffs and solos helped propel the Beatles to greatness and his experimentation with Eastern Indian music could be heard with his sitar work on "Norwegian Wood."Now, in a city park where there was once a specific wood -- a George Harrison tree -- there's a stump.But LaBonge, borrowing from a Harrison album title, vows "All Things Must Pass" including the lack of a George Harrison tree."When you plant a tree to memorialize someone, it's a special thing." LaBonge said. "And I promise you in November this will be special again when we dedicate the new tree."
