It came about 40 minutes after a neighbor's security camera captured the family's Isuzu pulling out of their cul-de-sac. Merritt didn't answer.Merritt told CNN he was watching television with his then-girlfriend, and he picked up the phone, looked at it and set it back down. He was tired. He called back the next day, he said."There are hundreds of scenarios. I have gone over all of them in my head," he said. "Of course, I regret not picking up the phone."Merritt was questioned by police after the disappearance. They just asked him the "standard questions," he said. He also claimed to have taken a polygraph test.Police had never named Merritt as a suspect before his arrest last Wednesday.
