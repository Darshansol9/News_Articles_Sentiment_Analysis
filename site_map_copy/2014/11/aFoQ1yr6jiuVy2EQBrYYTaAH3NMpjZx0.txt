Story highlights NASA astronauts put a GoPro camera in floating water bubble in spaceThe space agency posted a video about the feat this weekAdd another entry to the growing list of crazy footage captured by GoPro cameras.NASA posted a video this week of three astronauts playing with a floating, softball-sized water bubble aboard the International Space Station.That's been done before, but the trio added a new wrinkle: They put a sealed GoPro inside the bubble, creating an orbiting "bubblecam" that helped document the feat. They then recorded the whole thing with another camera, in 3-D."That's so wild!" says NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman in the clip, which has more than 800,000 views on YouTube.Yes. Yes it is.Wiseman joined fellow NASA astronaut Steve Swanson and European Space Agency astronaut Alexander Gerst last summer in shooting the video, which explores the phenomenon of water-surface tension in microgravity.Yes, we know becoming an astronaut is hard work, and that living in space is no picnic. But to us earthbound people, zero gravity sure looks like fun.
