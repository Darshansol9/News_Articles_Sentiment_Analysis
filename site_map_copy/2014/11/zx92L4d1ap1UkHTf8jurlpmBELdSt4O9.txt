Conditions will be ripe for wildfires.Yes, possibly wildfires in November.Highs in the 70s, perhaps up to 80 degrees, and dry, gusty winds are behind it. They will sap the air of moisture, and if a spark ignites, they could push the flames across the landscape.Wind and warmth will "contribute to extreme fire behavior," the weather service said, which issued a red flag warning, the highest alert. The state's wildfire fighting authority Cal Fire has put more firefighters on duty.It has also asked that residents not mow dry grass, pull a vehicle over onto it, toss cigarette butts on it -- and not to target shoot in undesignated areas, especially not at metal targets, which could make sparks fly.
