Methodology and findings of this investigation must be made publicly available."Attorneys: Time for 'global intervention'In a statement, the Browns' attorney's office said the couple planned to "testify on behalf of many supporters who join in the appeal for global intervention in the way policing currently functions in America."Their trip to Geneva marked the first time out of the United States for the couple, CNN affiliate KSDK reported."We've been received very well," McSpadden told CNN. "They've given us a lot of love and support since we've been here. Everything seems to be positive. It's a great experience."Michael Brown Sr. said he and his wife were offering "an outlook on what's going on in the United States and all over the world with the police, police brutality, no justice."Speaking of what life has been like since the killing, he said, "It's a situation where I'm surprised we haven't even lost our mind yet over this. But we're being strong. Hopefully, justice will prevail."The trip came as the parents, and many people throughout the United States, brace for the results of grand jury deliberations -- which will determine whether Wilson, 28, is indicted.The trip was organized by the U.S. Human Rights Network, which is based in New York and Atlanta, KSDK reported."Traditionally, if you look at the history of the Convention Against Torture, this is the correct location for claims of police violence," St. Louis University Assistant Professor Justin Hansford, one of the co-authors of the brief, told KSDK.
