It's rare to be suspended without pay, the fullest disciplinary action allowed under district policy, she said.Hegwood began meeting with administrators Monday at 7:15 a.m. By 8:30 a.m., "there was a conclusion and this decision had been made," Barager said.District employees do have the right to free speech, Barager said, but Hegwood's comments were so egregious, the school was left with "no other option."The board of trustees for the school district will decide Hegwood's fate at its next meeting on December 8.Hegwood's tweets are the latest example of the percolating tensions and controversy that have spread beyond the Ferguson city limits in the aftermath of the Brown shooting.In September, Ralph Weems, a Marine and Iraq war veteran, was severely beaten in a Mississippi restaurant parking lot. Weems, who is white, allegedly left a Waffle House after he was told it wasn't safe there for white people because patrons inside were upset about the Ferguson situation.JUST WATCHED Ferguson shooting used for political gain Replay More Videos ...
