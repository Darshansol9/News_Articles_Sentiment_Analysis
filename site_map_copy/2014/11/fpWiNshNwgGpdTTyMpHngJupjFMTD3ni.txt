They put up a sign on their front door: "Closed Until Further Notice!"The following morning, Cathy's Kitchen sat dark and silent. And broken.Loyal customers, guardian angelsThe Jenkinses knew their restaurant was not so badly damaged. They'd seen video of protesters locking arms in front of the place to protect it from vandals."I wish I knew who they were," said Jerome Jenkins, "because I really would like to thank them."The Jenkinses planned to wake up early, rustle up relatives and be there by 8 to begin cleaning up. But by the time they arrived, people were already picking up the shards of glass from the window that was shattered.They weren't members of the National Guard. Or any federal disaster agency. They were her customers, loyal to her on a day of tragedy."I am overwhelmed," she said.But this was the Ferguson she knew.

Then not to see a single military truck. ... That's troubling."Jerome Jenkins said authorities had four months to "get this right." He didn't understand why the decision was announced at night, why the police didn't react right away and why the military was not sent in after a state of emergency had been declared many days before.'I hate what I have seen'"I hate what I have seen on West Florissant," he said, referring to the main thoroughfare that intersects with the road where Brown was shot dead. It was the scene of nearly two weeks of protests, some violent, in the wake of the killing.After word spread that Wilson would not be indicted, protesters clashed with riot police in Ferguson. Many businesses had their doors and windows smashed in. Some were looted and set ablaze."Nobody was there to protect them," Jerome Jenkins said. "To the African-American community, that is the greatest form of racism. You don't protect and serve. You allow 20 to 30 criminals to come into our community and burn it down."JUST WATCHED The big guns of small-town cops Replay More Videos ...

"Poverty brings crime, and you will see that where you go in the world."Jenkins said he is not a man who would normally put his face in front of a television camera."But it's worth telling the world, 'Listen, it wasn't us as residents who dropped the ball.' "After the cleanup Tuesday, the Jenkinses hope to leave for Indiana, where they both grew up, to enjoy Thanksgiving with family and friends. And to heal.They don't know what will happen in the next few nights, whether there will be more trouble. They hope to hang the "open" sign on the door again very soon. Perhaps even as early as Monday.
