(CNN) An early blast of cold air will leave more than half of the United States shivering into the weekend.About 200 million people will be affected by the severe cold, CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri said.The unseasonably cold temperatures associated with an arctic air mass will continue to surge southward through the central United States.Temperatures are forecast to be 20 to 40 degrees below climate average for areas east of the Rockies into the Great Plains.The cold air will move toward the South by Wednesday morning, bringing freezing temperatures as far south as Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle.It will reach the East Coast by Thursday, forecasters said."Early season cold outbreak will drift south and eastward across much of the eastern half of the country over the next several days," the National Weather Service said in a statement.By the time the weekend hits, hardly anyone in the eastern two-thirds of the nation will be spared."The next 10 days over the entire eastern half of the country will be below normal," CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said Tuesday.In Wyoming, the wind chill is expected to be between 25 to 35 below zero. Experts warned residents not to stay outside for prolonged periods, and urged farmers to move livestock into a barn."The cold spell is about zero degrees, and we will get subzero overnight," said Mayor Rick Kaysen of Cheyenne, Wyoming.JUST WATCHED Early snow blankets Midwest Replay More Videos ...

There was advance information coming in regard of the intensity of the storm and what to expect."In Minnesota, though tempered by years of long brutal winters, this snap came a little too soon."This is the first snow I've seen this season, and it's a major snowstorm, rather than the usual light dusting you'd expect to start off the winter with," said Katie Robinson of St. Paul."I think that's the biggest thing -- that we went from a very warm and mild fall to now being thrust so abruptly into winter."In Montana, temperatures plummeted as bitterly cold winds rushed down the front range of the Rocky Mountains.In Billings, Wednesday will bring overnight lows below zero and daytime highs in the single digits.With overnight temperatures plunging close to record lows, downtown Billings, the heart of Montana's largest city, was empty.Those who did venture out in the cold said they were ready."We just watched the alerts, and when they say it's going to be cold, we just bundle up," resident Tessa Rogers said.South will get hit, tooJUST WATCHED What is a polar vortex?
