The suspect was originally charged as a juvenile, but that was subsequently changed to charged as an adult, police said.Sash Alexander Nemphos was charged with handgun possession, three counts of theft, possession of a destructive device and possession of a dangerous weapon on school property, police said.They reported the suspect told an officer he had taken the gun to school Friday, but decided not to do anything until Monday. He is being held without bail.Police Chief Jim Johnson praised the first responding officer for "an exceptional job of police work" and said the officer intervened in what could have been a dangerous situation.It does not appear the teen had any co-conspirators, police said.County police and Baltimore County Public Schools are cooperating in the ongoing investigation.
