A number of less intense earthquakes occurred on Wednesday, the USGC said."We had put our Christmas tree up and every ornament shaking," said Kristi Clinage of Medford, Oklahoma. "In fact, my dog was sleeping in the chair. He came over and looked me like, 'What's going on?' "Clinage said she had no damage at her coffee shop but noticed several people had posted on Facebook photos of cracked walls. Medford is about 20 miles south of the Kansas border.Grace Fisher, an employee at Hired Man's Grocery & Grill in Conway Springs, Kansas, was at work when the quake hit."I was standing at the register," she said. "There are racks of candy nearby. They were quivering and shaking."Her first thought was that something had hit the building, but one of the customers said, "Oh my God, that was an earthquake," Fisher said.Callers to KSN told about their earthquake experience."The earthquake here in Derby was the largest I have ever felt," said Bart Chilcott. "The shaking was violent at first and then slowly tapered off after about 30 seconds. What amazed me most was the roaring sound it made."
