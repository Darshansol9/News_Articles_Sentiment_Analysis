"We are very excited to celebrate this historic milestone with every loving couple from today onward."In November, the Illinois General Assembly passed the Religious Freedom and Marriage Fairness Act, making Illinois the 16th state in the nation to legalize same-sex marriage. The measure goes into effect June 1Last month, the gay rights group Lambda Legal and the ACLU filed a class-action lawsuit in Illinois on behalf of same-sex couples who wanted to immediately obtain marriage licenses in Cook County.Christopher Clark, counsel for Lambda Legal, said the case originally arose after a couple facing life-threatening illness came forward saying they didn't feel they could wait until June to be married.Clark called Friday's ruling an "absolute ringing affirmation of the principles of liberty and equality that are at the foundations of our constitution."Clark said the ruling sets a precedent for same-sex marriage in other states and called it "another step in resolving the issue across the country."
