The third bullet struck him in the leg."There was obviously some kind of intervention involved in this incident, because he probably should not be here," Dayton Police Sgt. Michael Pauley told WHIO.Wagoner told police he believes the assault was part of a gang initiation. Wagoner said he heard one suspect tell another that he needed to "kill the polar bear" in order to be "all the way in the club," according to WHIO.Dayton police, however, said it was too early in the investigation to draw any conclusions about the motive.During the attack, Wagoner told police, he used an aluminum pen from his pocket to stab one of the teenage boys in the leg, according to WHIO. The suspects dropped the gun and fled as Wagoner picked up the weapon and opened fire.Wagoner was transported to a hospital and was being treated for a bullet wound to the leg, among other injuries, according to WHIO. His injuries are not life-threatening, police said.Police were searching for the three male suspects.The condition of the book, which police described as a religious devotional entitled "The Message," was unknown. "The Message" is a translation of the Bible into contemporary language by Eugene Peterson.
