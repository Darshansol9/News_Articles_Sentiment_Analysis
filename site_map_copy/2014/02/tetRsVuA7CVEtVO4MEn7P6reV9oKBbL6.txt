"We sincerely apologize to our viewers and readers for this inaccurate report," the network said.After the midafternoon storm, the National Weather Service in Melbourne, Florida, later canceled the tornado warning for parts of Volusia County, including the area around the Daytona International Speedway."The safety of our race fans is always a primary concern.
