"But the police department showed up. My firm . ... is a security firm, thank goodness, so they knew how to handle it immediately. They did a a test. The preliminary test is that it's nontoxic... We don't know if it's connected to the six or seven that were sent in New Jersey."He added, "It's kind of a strange letter, more than a threatening letter. Said something about 'you're being my best friend' and this person is not my best friend or my assistant's best friend, or anyone we know. ... At this point, all we know is the good news is it's not toxic. The bad news is we don't really know if it's connected."The letter was postmarked from Toronto, Ontario, and contained a name and return address.
