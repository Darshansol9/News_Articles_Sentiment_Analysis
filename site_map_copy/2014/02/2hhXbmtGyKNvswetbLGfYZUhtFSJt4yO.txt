His hormones are raging and he is constantly testing limits.Because the koala was not in any danger and did not pose any risk to the public, zookeepers took shifts watching Mundu in the tree.When the zoo closed, they lured him back into his exhibit. Mundu was then checked by a veterinarian.According to the San Diego Zoo website, the facility is famous for having the largest koala colony and the most successful breeding program outside of Australia.
