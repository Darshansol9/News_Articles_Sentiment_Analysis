A handful of protesters presented a petition to an airline spokeswoman asking it to end its business relationship with SeaWorld. Southwest responded in a statement it was not contemplating changes to its multi-year contract with the entertainment company.Perhaps the largest fallout was in the form of a virtual cavalcade of musicians backing out of SeaWorld's "Bands, Brew & BBQ" concert series.Willie Nelson, Trace Adkins, Trisha Yearwood and Joan Jett are among those who declined to perform at the theme park over the controversy.SeaWorld has battled back against the claims "Blackfish" makes, calling the film grossly one-sided and the product of animal activists.The company has declined CNN's repeated requests for interviews, but has responded to written inquiries."Blackfish is billed as a documentary, but instead of a fair and balanced treatment of a complex subject, the film is inaccurate and misleading and, regrettably, exploits a tragedy that remains a source of deep pain for Dawn Brancheau's family, friends and colleagues," SeaWorld said in a statement."To promote its bias that killer whales should not be maintained in a zoological setting, the film paints a distorted picture that withholds from viewers key facts about SeaWorld -- among them, that SeaWorld is one of the world's most respected zoological institutions, that SeaWorld rescues, rehabilitates and returns to the wild hundreds of wild animals every year, and that SeaWorld commits millions of dollars annually to conservation and scientific research."In January, Brancheau's family distanced themselves from the documentary."Blackfish is not Dawn's story. Dawn Brancheau believed in the ethical treatment of animals. Dawn followed her dreams and became a marine animal trainer. She loved the whales and was proud of her work as a trainer," a statement on a charity website dedicated to the slain trainer said."Dawn would not have remained a trainer at SeaWorld for 15 years if she felt that the whales were not well cared for. Trainer safety was important to Dawn, and it remains important to us as well. Our family always supported Dawn and we continue to support Dawn's friends and co-workers who currently care for the animals she so loved."JUST WATCHED The story of a killer whale Replay More Videos ...

"The Blackfish crusade against SeaWorld and zoological care in general is engineered by a perfect marriage between sensational animal rights organizations and disgruntled ex-SeaWorld employees."Meantime, the marine park giant announced record fourth-quarter results and record annual revenue results in January, indicating there appears to be no real impact on its business.JUST WATCHED La respuesta de SeaWorld Replay More Videos ...

The next scheduled acts, Gretchen Wilson and Bill Engvall, are also expected to perform before an at-capacity crowd, the company said.The show, much like the debate Blackfish continues to spark, goes on.
