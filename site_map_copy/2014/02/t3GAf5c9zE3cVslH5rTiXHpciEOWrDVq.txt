According to the group event's Facebook page, the students planned to form a human wall to block off the Westboro protesters."The focus of this wall is unification behind Sam to represent this school as One," the Facebook page stated. A total of 4,952 people responded to the page.The Westboro protesters had announced that they planned to show up at 1:30 p.m., so the Mizzou students assembled at 1 p.m. and formed a long human chain that surrounded the campus. Many wore the school colors of black and gold and carried handmade signs that used the hashtag #StandwithSam. By the time Westboro protestors did arrive, all they could do was wave their signs, because they couldn't get close to the school.JUST WATCHED Ex-church member: They brainwashed me Replay More Videos ...
