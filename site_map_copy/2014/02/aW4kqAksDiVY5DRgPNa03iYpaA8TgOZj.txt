Story highlights In a Facebook post, he declared northern Georgia 'NO VALENTINES DAY ZONE'Sheriff Scott Berry has rescheduled the lovers' fest to TuesdayHe did it to make his staff and their spouses laughResidents took to Facebook and got in on the funBy pronouncement of the sheriff, there will be no Valentine's Day this Friday. That is, if you live in Georgia, north of Interstate 16 and have to drive to get a gift.Oconee County Sheriff Scott Berry has designated northern Georgia a "NO VALENTINES DAY ZONE" in a post on the department's Facebook page Wednesday night.Men are "exempt from having to run out and buy lottery scratchers and Hershey bars from the corner stores until February 18, 2014, due to ice, snow, freezing rain," the tongue-in-cheek post said.It's all in fun.

You should've planned ahead.Ogle, the sheriff's dispatcher, did."Mine's covered. I told her her gift is in the top dresser drawer," he said.But for those who didn't manage a gift due to the ice and snow, commenter Bo Edwards has a suggestion for what they can tell their loved ones:"It's the thaw(t) that counts...."
