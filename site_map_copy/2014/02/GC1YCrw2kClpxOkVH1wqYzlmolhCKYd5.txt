They complied with the request.Fire Chief Dave Hanneman stood by the crew that remained."We don't know what was going through the officer's mind," Hanneman told CNN affiliate KSWB . "From our perspective, our engineer was out there doing what they're trained to do and doing everything right to take care of patient care and protect that scene."The incident prompted a meeting between CHP and Chula Vista officials Wednesday.In a joint statement released after the session, they called the officer's detention an "unfortunate incident," labeling it "an isolated incident and not representative of the manner in which our agencies normally work together toward our common goal."The statement promised the incident will be a topic of future joint training sessions between the two agencies.
