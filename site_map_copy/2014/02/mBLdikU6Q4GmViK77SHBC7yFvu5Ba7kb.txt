I want the LGBT community living in Russia to know they are not alone and I hope others realize this is not only a gay rights issue, but a global concern for human rights and equality," she wrote."As I said when I was named to the U.S. delegation, I hope these Olympics will be a watershed moment for the universal acceptance of all people."The closing ceremony takes place on February 23.President Barack Obama also named Deputy Secretary of State William Burns and U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul to the delegation, as well as former gold medal Olympians Bonnie Blair and Eric Heider, a White House statement said.The delegates will watch some events and meet U.S. athletes as well as attend the final ceremony.
