The free seminars were a marketing tool that brought many clients to the law firm.Another CNN affiliate, WTVF, reported that the Setzers moved from Nashville to Lebanon to be closer to their four grandchildren, daughter and the son-in-law who would be charged in their killing.Jon Setzer and his son-in-law were business partners, the affiliate reported.Records show that Parker was the owner of a business called Legacy Restorations, but the documents do not mention Setzer. The contracting business -- whose address is the same as Parker's home address -- has less than five employees and has been in operation for 23 years, records show.After the bombing and Parker's arrest, those who knew the Setzers are struggling for answers."They were just sweet people," said the Rev. Mike Ripski, pastor at First United Methodist Church in Lebanon."Jon I think qualifies for the adjective of 'erudite,' " Ripski told CNN. "He was articulate, he was knowledgeable, a wonderful teacher of his Sunday school class."Jon Setzer had been a lay preacher, and he taught children until his health began deteriorating.Ripski recalls Marion Setzer being at a worship service just this week."They're the kind of people that you might describe as being ordinarily extraordinary," the pastor said. "They went about what they did in a quiet way but very effective way."Ripski also reflected on the loss that the Setzers suffered when their son was killed."Instead of their becoming angry or bitter or depressed, that experience -- because they were open to being redeemed by the grace of God -- turned them into the beautiful people that they were, people that so many of us were blessed by," he said.
