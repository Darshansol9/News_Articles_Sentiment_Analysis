Obama issued the order at the request of Gov. Tom Corbett."It is imperative that parties continue to work toward an agreement for the benefit of the tens of thousands of people who use SEPTA rail every day," Corbett said in a written statement.The dispute between the engineers and electrician unions and SEPTA revolves around pay raises and pensions.The strike affected 13 lines that serve the suburbs and the Philadelphia International Airport, officials said.It includes engineers who drive or operate the commuter rail lines, said Jerri Williams, spokeswoman for the transportation AuthorityThe lines affected carry about 60,000 commuters daily, which is 10% of the total ridership in the Philadelphia area, she said."As long as these workers show up for their regularly scheduled Sunday shifts, regional rail service will be restored to full Sunday operations in the morning," Williams said.
