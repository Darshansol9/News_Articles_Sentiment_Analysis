At the same time.The rare twin tornadoes that spun through on Monday night wiped out the town's business district, obliterated its fire station and ground 40 or 50 homes into rubble, Stanton County Sheriff Mike Unger said.As much as three-fourths of the town of 350 is gone, Unger said. Two people died during the storm -- one a 5-year-old. The second death -- a traffic accident -- was probably weather-related, Unger said.Faith Regional Health Services in Norfolk said 16 people were critically injured in the storms.In southern Wisconsin, a line of thunderstorms that spawned twisters rolled through late Monday and early Tuesday.The town of Madison was hit hard.

No watches or warnings were in effect Tuesday afternoon.Back in Pilger, storm chasers captured dramatic video of the twin tornadoes tearing through the countryside. At one point, the twisters straddled a state highway."It was terribly wide," Marianne Pesotta told CNN affiliate KETV-TV . "I drove east (to escape). I could see how bad it was. I had to get out of there."Hauf and other employees of the Farmers Co-op in Pilger rode out the storm in the convenience store's cooler."It seemed like forever, but I guess it was only a couple minutes, and it was coming down on top of us," Hauf told CNN's "New Day. "But the coolers held together wonderfully."When she emerged, the first thing she noticed was the condition of the stock in the store where she'd worked for 20 years."I guess the first thing I saw was a ... cupcake box and a 24-pack of Bud Light," she said.Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman, who will tour the storm damage Tuesday, issued a state of emergency, putting the National Guard on standby to help if needed.
