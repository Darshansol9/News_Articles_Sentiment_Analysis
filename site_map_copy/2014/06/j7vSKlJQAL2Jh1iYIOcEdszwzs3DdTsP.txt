There were no injuries, according to CNN affiliate KSDK"I was nervous, a little scared but at the same time excited," he recalled on "New Day."Sure, it was his first sky dive ever, he said, but he had excellent training at Southern Illinois University.Laughing, Kinmartin said he really likes sky diving and wants to do it again -- next time on a tandem jump from a little higher up.
