Story highlights Source tied to NBA: Hiring investigators part of a "strategy of intimidation""Multiple private investigation firms" have been hired by Sterling, a source saysSource: They each have a $50,000 budget, 30 days to finish their probesInvestigators will look into instances of discrimination, NBA executives payDonald Sterling is digging into his wallet to dig into the NBA and its owners.In his latest salvo against the league that's moved to oust him over racist remarks, the embattled Los Angeles Clippers co-owner has hired "multiple private investigation firms" to look into alleged discriminatory conduct by fellow team owners and the NBA itself, said a person familiar with Sterling's legal strategy.He will give each firm a budget of $50,000 and 30 days to finish an investigation, according to this source, who is not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity.After initially signaling his openness to this deal, Sterling has backed off. Not only won't he sell the franchise -- as league leaders have insisted should happen -- but Sterling insists he won't pay a $2.5 million fine or accept a lifetime ban ordered by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver.JUST WATCHED Sterling flip-flops, fights NBA Replay More Videos ...

The AP described its source as a person familiar with Sterling's legal strategy, though it wasn't immediately clear whether this was the same person who talked to CNN.Sterling came under fire in April, when TMZ posted audio of him talking to his companion V. Stiviano. The release spurred an uproar among league officials, fans and players, who reportedly threatened to boycott playing in the NBA playoffs if Sterling still was in control of the Clippers.That's when Adam Silver stepped in, swiftly banishing Sterling from any team or league activities and promising to work to oust him as an owner. The Clippers co-owner defended his actions -- including a CNN interview that drew more harsh criticism for remarks about basketball legend Magic Johnson -- and went back-and-forth about what to do, before apparently settling on an all-out fight with the league.Sterling voiced particular dismay about the NBA commissioner, who took over that job earlier in 2014 after years in the league office. To that end, the investigators he's hired will look into compensation paid to top NBA executives, past and present, according to CNN's source familiar with Sterling's legal strategy.As to investigating fellow NBA owners, this source said Sterling was reluctant to do so, but felt he needed to at this time.Dispute over Sterling's mental state, family trustWhile a large-scale investigation certainly marks an escalation, it can't come as a total surprise.Earlier this week, the 80-year-old Sterling defiantly called the NBA "a band of hypocrites and bullies" that needs to examine its own "discriminatory practices" rather than try to take away his personal property. This happened days after he sued the NBA for more than $1 billion over its decision to ban him for life and force him to sell the franchise."We have to fight for the rights of all Americans. We have to fight these despicable monsters," Sterling wrote in a statement, provided to CNN by Bobby Samini, one of his lawyers.Talking to ABC about the Sterling accusation at the halftime of an NBA finals game between the San Antonio Spurs and the Miami Heat, Silver said he had "no idea what he's talking about.""This is about Donald Sterling and his conduct," the commissioner said. "And if he wants to litigate, he'll litigate."The NBA isn't alone in its fight.The probate court will hold a four-day hearing next month that will focus on whether she has the power to sell the team if her co-owner is incapacitated. The AP source said the probate court decision prompted Sterling to hire the investigators."It's unfortunate. Mrs. Sterling regrets having to go to court and publicly air this problem," said her attorney, Pierce O'Donnell. "But Mr. Sterling's conduct in reneging on the sale requires her to do so."Though the Clippers are owned by a family trust, Shelly Sterling's attorney has said three physicians certified that Donald Sterling lacks the mental capacity to function as a trustee."The trust agreement provides that if two qualified physicians certify that he's mentally incapacitated, he's removed," O'Donnell said.Though she said three doctors have reviewed evidence and concluded that Donald Sterling is mentally incapacitated, his lawyer has said he is far from incapacitated.
