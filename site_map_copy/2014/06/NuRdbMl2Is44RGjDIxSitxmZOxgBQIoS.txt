Story highlights Media report says nanny offered to leave by July 4Bracamonte family reportedly rejected one of the nanny's conditions for departureA California judge ruled in favor of the nanny as a tenant in the homeThe family fired her in early June after the nanny stopped workingA California family's nanny nightmare may be nearing an end.More than three weeks ago the Bracamonte family fired Diane Stretton, 64, but she refused to leave their home. Police told the family they couldn't force Stretton out of their Upland, California, home without an eviction notice.A judge even ruled in Stretton's favor, deciding the Bracamonte's did not terminate Stretton's employment in a legal manner. The family said Stretton then threatened to sue them if they tried to force her out.Now Stretton has offered to move out, according to ABC News, but under her conditions. Stretton called the family's attorney late Saturday night "and said she could be out by July 4," Marcella Bracamonte said on "Good Morning America" Sunday. But Bracamonte said that won't work for her family because they plan to be out of town.So it's still unclear at this point if, in fact, the nanny will leave of her own free will or whether the family will have to continue through with the eviction process, now underway, before they can call their home their own again."This is now by court, by law, this is her domain, " Ralph Bracamonte told ABC News.JUST WATCHED Family: Fired nanny refuses to leave Replay More Videos ...
