Last summer, the FAA authorized drone flights over Arctic waters.The FAA has greatly restricted the commercial use of drones over U.S. land and water as it seeks to safely integrate them into national airspace. Entities that fly drones must first get certificates of authorization, and those have gone chiefly to government enterprises and those conducting research.Under AeroVironment's certificate, the company can operate only in daytime, where there is a visibility of 3 miles, and the aircraft must be kept in sight. The company must also notify air traffic controllers.Last week, the FAA announced that Nevada will host the third of six congressionally mandated drone research sites. The FAA granted the Nevada team a two-year certificate to use an Insitu ScanEagle at the Desert Rock Airport in Mercury, Nevada. Desert Rock, owned and operated by the Department of Energy, is a private airport and not for general use.
