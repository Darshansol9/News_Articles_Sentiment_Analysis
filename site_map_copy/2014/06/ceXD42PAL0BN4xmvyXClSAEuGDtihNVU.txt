He's undergoing therapy.Although the road ahead for the Willeys and their three children is uncertain, they're hopeful that the slow-growing tumor is benign and was caught before it was too late.A fund has been set up to help pay for the family's medical expenses."It's hard to be thankful to somebody who was so violent," Alisha Willey said. "I'm just very blessed that my husband is still alive and that it wasn't over that morning."
