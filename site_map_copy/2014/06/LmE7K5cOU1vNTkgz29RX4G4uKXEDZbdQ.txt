Story highlights ACLU hopes decision will serve as a "wake-up call" to the government"No fly" list is enforced on commercial airline flightsBut a judge says there's no reasonable way for people to get off of itMuslim-Americans challenged the government in courtThe U.S. government's "no fly" list violates constitutional protections by depriving travelers of a meaningful way to have their names removed, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday.U.S. District Judge Anna Brown of Portland, Oregon, ordered the Justice Department to redraft procedures "with the requisite due process" and without jeopardizing national security.Thirteen plaintiffs, mostly Muslim-Americans, challenged their inclusion on the list. They said they were denied boarding on flights without explanation and were not allowed to present evidence to show they were no threat to public safety."A traveler who has not been given any indication of the information that may be in the record does not have any way to correct that information," Brown wrote in her 65-page opinion and order.The "no-fly" list produced by the FBI was created after the 9/11 al Qaeda hijacking of four airliners as an anti-terror measure. It has been expanded over the years and includes thousands of names.JUST WATCHED No-fly toddler? Girl removed from flight Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH No-fly toddler?

We hope this serves as a wake-up call for the government to fix its broken watch-list system, which has swept up so many innocent people," Shamsi said.
