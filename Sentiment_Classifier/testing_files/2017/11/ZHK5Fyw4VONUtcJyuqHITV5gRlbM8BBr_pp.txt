cnn floating zero gravity put quite squeeze human brain according study published new england journal medicine wednesday researcher scanned astronaut brain using magnetic resonance imaging varying length space mission the mri scan revealed brain change majority astronaut returned long term spaceflight mission appears increased cerebrospinal fluid upward shift brain within skull wrote rachael seidler professor university florida department applied physiology kinesiology email seidler participated similar study involved one similar recent finding spaceflight duration effect said additional cerebrospinal fluid squeeze brain making space brain region appear smaller it important follow additional study examine long lasting change cerebrospinal fluid surround brain help maintain normal function disturbance balance fluid cause change cognitive brain function wrote dr donna robert lead author study associate professor medical university south carolina email hypothesize upward brain shift expansion tissue along top brain may result compression adjacent venous structure along top head said prove yet suspect may ultimately result decrease outflow cerebrospinal fluid blood head astronauts experience fluid shift enter zero gravity effectively turn natural process body upside though adjustment microgravity take long issue arise within first day due phenomenon head naturally tilt downward 12 20 degree zero gravity causing disorientation soon arrive weightlessness fluid start shifting body lower part body upper part body dr john charles nasa human research program associate manager international science previously told cnn organs balance inner ear immediately sense gravity pulling anymore causes something known among astronaut bird leg syndrome fluid shift cause puffy face thin leg it also make le thirsty dulls sense taste cause stuffy nose feeling similar allergy space motion sickness also affect 79 astronaut first 24 48 hour microgravity creating loss appetite dizziness vomiting 34 astronaut participated nasa funded study including 28 men six woman 18 part long term space mission international space station there originally 35 astronaut one excluded technical reason sixteen part short duration shuttle flight the average length long term mission 165 day space short term mission averaged around 13 day space seventeen 18 long term astronaut experienced narrowing central sulcus brain this present three short term astronaut central sulcus critical area separate region responsible much motor function region regulates input sensory stimulus robert said it important astronaut adapting space critical mission task continuous change make extreme environment upward shift brain overall seen 12 long term astronaut none participated short term mission narrowing cerebrospinal fluid space vertex top skull apparent 12 long term astronaut one short term astronaut know change continue worsen mission duration may eventually reach plateau robert said results highlight importance brain imaging astronaut long duration mission return earth also time back earth ass whether structural change persistent return baseline short term spaceflight astronaut brain left mission addition three astronaut long duration spaceflight group experienced visual impairment intracranial pressure syndrome viip one recent effect spaceflight noticed past five seven year scott kelly retired astronaut late 40 50 complained vision slightly altered some required glass flight changes visual acuity charles said able see thing close it like advanced aging that sort thing happens sort accelerated rate given connection eye optic nerve brain combined fluid shift astronaut experience research suggested eye act pressure release valve but study needed three astronaut developed visual impairment also experienced narrowing central sulcus brain theory based nasa report approximately 60 astronaut long duration mission experience degradation visual acuity approximately 40 astronaut classified viip syndrome robert said imaging change see present long duration astronaut 3 astronaut experienced severe form viip we suspect many astronaut might experienced milder form viip understanding visual impairment brain shift order develop countermeasure key nasa considers lengthy mission mar could require nine month traveling one way part study confirm difference brain scan shown two neuroradiologists told flight duration whether scan taken flight they also able toggle image way showed obvious difference although radiation also negatively impact astronaut concern charles limoli professor university california irvine department radiation oncology involved study said nothing data set suggest space radiation cause change mri signal observed shift brain directly response lack gravity line finding previous study although study astronaut space replicated effect zero gravity earth people rest bed head tilt position follow cnn health facebook twitter see latest news share comment cnn health facebook twitter finding actual astronaut provide strong beginning researcher wanting connect dot neurophysiological anatomical change brain caused zero gravity study raise lot question health implication seidler said really finding point importance follow study determine health cognitive implication recovery time course change roberts team seidler collaborating separate nasa funded study take bed rest model earth includes atmosphere like astronaut experience space station robert also continuing key point raised new study plan evaluate outcome astronaut test motor performance cognition following spaceflight determine correlation structural brain change mri said
