cnn japan relationship energy sector best complicated virtually oil coal natural gas fire power plant japan forced import 90 energy 2014 it world third largest importer oil coal number one importer liquefied natural gas furthermore 50 plus nuclear reactor considered brilliant solution energy resource dearth today mostly stand idle following devastating fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant meltdown 2011 japanese scientist may found innovative end country energy woe pioneering new technology could reshape global energy industry even better technology revolves around resource japan abundance buried ocean japanese government want burn flammable ice energy new type energyworldwide 2 800 trillion cubic meter methane bearing gas hydrate frozen mixture water natural methane according united state energy information administration vast reservoir resource found high pressure low temperature combine buried inside thick arctic permafrost deep ocean floor possibly planet last great source carbon based fuel gas hydrate thought contain energy world fossil fuel combinedso far though one close able extract commercially japan trying between 2002 2017 government spent around 1 billion research development according ministry energy trade industry two reason government want develop technology say ryo matsumoto professor geology gas hydrate laboratory tokyo meiji university first secure energy resource exploit domestic resource increase energy security the second trying decrease carbon dioxide emission fossil fuel natural gas consumption emits roughly half amount carbon dioxide coal natural gas cleaner source energy japan want increase proportion natural gas used entire energy structure flammable ice flammable ice look different something might use chill cocktail similarity stop scientist hold marine natural gas hydrate trapped icelike crystal extracted seabed shenhu area northern south china sea similar marine natural gas hydrate extracted japan ice crystal hold remarkable quantity natural methane gas it estimated one cubic meter frozen gas hydrate contains 164 cubic meter methane hold match ice gas ignites instead melting burn the problem gas hydrate gas hard extract first step however find hydrate in japan hard japan rich reserve within exclusive economic zone western pacific ocean side along eastern margin japan sea side say matsumoto engineer far focused nankai trough long narrow depression 50 kilometer coast central japan extensively surveyed many year analysis extracted core sample seismic data revealed 1 1 trillion cubic meter methane enough meet japan gas need decade lie floor trough first extractionin 2013 mh21 research consortium methane hydrate resource japanese government funded research group brings together industry expert scientist policymakers conducted world first extraction test team positioned drillship chikyu formation called daini atsumi knoll lie 1 000 meter sea south japanese city nagoya extract gas hydrate must first melted separate gas water say dr koji yamamoto leader research group field development technology mh21 photo japan drill flammable ice pre drilling expedition feb march 2012 drill ship chikyu setting sail nankai trough pre drilling expedition hide caption 1 5 photo japan drill flammable ice pre drilling expedition feb march 2012 team used logging drilling tool get real time information operation drilling conducted hide caption 2 5 photo japan drill flammable ice gas production test jan march 2013 pre drilling test year protective structure installed onto head production well this prevented anything falling well removing structure mark start preparation production testing hide caption 3 5 photo japan drill flammable ice gas production experiment april july 2017 2017 team began extracting methane gas hydrate because yet equipment store methane burned hide caption 4 5 photo japan drill flammable ice gas production experiment april july 2017 team measured volume gas extracted monitoring system hide caption 5 5the hydrate melt nudged stability zone achieved either raising temperature lowering pressure pumping hot water seabed heat hydrate would require lot energy explains yamamoto chose depressurization effective method engineer drilled well sea bed used submersible pump suck water sediment water level sediment drop pressure drop this trigger surrounding gas hydrate start separating say yamamoto water discharged sea freed gas piped surface getting closer goldyamamoto team became first world extract natural gas offshore gas hydrate reserve but operation short lived the venture shut day sand got pipe earlier year team made second attempt constructed two production well coated pipe special polymer reinforce sand intrusion one well still shut sand gas kept flowing total 235 000 cubic meter gas extracted according mh21 produced lot gas found reliable solution sand problem yet say yamamoto rivalry chinajapan course country eye flammable ice old rival china also hoping find relatively clean substitute smog producing coal promising reserve discovered south china sea 2007 country successfully extracted offshore gas hydrate may 2017 united state extracted natural gas hydrate locked frozen tundra alaska north slope current glut cheap shale gas le incentive invest heavily long term however gas hydrate could dramatic impact global gas market natural gas could extracted economically gas hydrate would reshape energy world say christopher knittel professor applied economics massachusetts institute technology sloan school management implications astounding the price natural gas throughout world would pegged price extracting hydrate trial mining flammable ice shenhu area south china sea hainan china flammable ice mined area despite number technological hurdle still cleared yamamoto remains cautiously optimistic twenty year ago nobody believed shale gas could used energy source now with technique currently available le economical imported natural gas but future could change environmental impact environmental risk technology one possibility extraction could destabilize sea floor send sediment tumbling continental slope in worst case scenario underwater landslide could trigger tsunami yamamoto say possibility happening low gas hydrate melt need use external energy source when stop energy input process automatically stabilized area japanese scientist focused seismically active team also spotted scar old landslide sea floor yamamoto say addressed issue installing monitoring device around test area detect subsidence allowing investigate ongoing level risk matsumoto le convinced disaster take place guarantee able control ceasing inject energy closing depressurization process the risk higher nankai trough seismologist warning possibility megathrust earthquake within decade megathrust earthquake occurs destructive plate boundary powerful kind magnitude exceed 9 gas leakage another frequently cited concern methane could accidentally released atmosphere methane 84 time potent greenhouse gas carbon dioxide 20 year timeframecarolyn ruppel chief united state geological survey gas hydrate project say gas leak sea floor unlikely cause catastrophe people imagine would lead increased methane concentration atmosphere exacerbate global warming but found methane emitted sea floor 100 meter rarely make way water column instead methane dissolve seawater consumed bacteria convert carbon dioxide ruppel point evidence gathered deepwater horizon oil spill gulf mexico 2010 coast guard battle blazing remnant offshore oil rig deepwater horizon gulf mexico april 21 2010 near new orleans louisiana large amount methane emitted seafloor studies carried afterward determined methane reach sea air interface injected atmosphere say methane leak would innocuous add could increase carbon dioxide concentration ocean furthermore although cleaner coal oil natural gas still fossil fuel produce carbon dioxide undergoes combustion green campaigner concerned new source cheap abundant natural gas might slow adoption renewable technology solar wind power knittel hope natural gas could act bridging fuel ways renewables natural gas complement since reliability natural gas counteract intermittency renewables futureuntil year test yamamoto say japanese government hoping see commercial production running late 2020s according yamamoto look date put back decade current cost high make gas hydrate extraction commercially viable focus economics though government task develop technique collect data provide information private company need mission extract natural gas hydrate reducing energy bill domestic energy source reason important japan future energy security
