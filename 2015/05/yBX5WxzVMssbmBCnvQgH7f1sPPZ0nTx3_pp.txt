scientist expect learn dawn gradually lowered 235 mile surface cere december mystery solved said cere seems lot oddity see many strange feature raymond said see smooth area area chaotically fractured see crater size one thing scientist noticed round cere being round important main characteristic planet title cere lost cere demoted asteroid 19th century astronomer sure round but bumped dwarf planet category created 2006 according international astronomical union group came definition dwarf planet similar eight main planet mercury venus earth mar jupiter saturn uranus neptune except lot stuff
