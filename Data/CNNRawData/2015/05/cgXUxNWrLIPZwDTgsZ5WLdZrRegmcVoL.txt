That's how New York Police Commissioner William Bratton described Brian Moore, the NYC officer who was shot while on duty during the weekend. Moore, 25, died yesterday . Moore was shot in the head when he and a fellow officer were trying to question a man in Queens. Moore had received two exceptional police service medals during his career. "We don't give them out easily," Bratton said. "He worked for them; he earned them." The man accused of the shooting, Demetrius Blackwell, was arrested and charged with first-degree attempted murder, charges likely to be upgraded with Moore's death.PRESIDENTIAL RACEThe Republican presidential field got a little more crowded yesterday, with both retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina announcing their candidacies. Carson, in his hometown of Detroit, told supporters he wasn't going to be politically correct because he's "not a politician." He also retold the story of his rise from poverty to becoming a pediatric neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins. Fiorina jumped into the race during an appearance on "Good Morning America," declaring she was best suited to be president because she understands "how the economy actually works." Neither Carson nor Fiorina has ever held elected office.BENGHAZI HEARINGSHillary Clinton is willing to testify before the House committee investigating the Benghazi attack later this month. Rep. Trey Gowdy, the committee's chairman, wants Clinton to appear on two separate days -- one day to talk about Benghazi and on another day to discuss her private email server. But Clinton's lawyer nixed that idea, saying it made more sense for the former secretary of state and current presidential candidate to discuss both topics during a single appearance. The top Democrat on the panel, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, said yesterday that Gowdy "should take 'yes' for an answer and finally schedule the hearing." Gowdy and the panel are mulling their options.
