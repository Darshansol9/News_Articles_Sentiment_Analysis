(CNN) The Wisconsin police officer who shot and killed a 19-year-old unarmed biracial man won't face criminal charges in the case."I conclude that this tragic and unfortunate death was the result of a lawful use of deadly police force and that no charges should be brought against Officer Kenny in the death of Tony Robinson Jr.," Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne said Tuesday.Robinson was fatally shot by Officer Matt Kenny, who is white, in Madison, Wisconsin, on March 6, setting off days of protests in the city. His death came amid lingering tensions over the killings by police elsewhere of other unarmed African-Americans that seized national attention.The police union praised Tuesday's announcement."We believe the district attorney's decision today to exonerate Officer Matthew Kenny was appropriate," Wisconsin Professional Police Association Executive Director Jim Palmer said in a statement. "The exhaustive, independent and transparent investigation into this tragic incident has confirmed that Officer Kenny's actions on the night of March 6 were lawful and in response to a deadly threat, from which Officer Kenny sustained numerous injuries, including a concussion.But the decision not to charge Kenny drew swift criticism from several of Robinson's family members, who briefly spoke with reporters after meeting with the district attorney on Tuesday."This is politics, and not justice," grandmother Sharon Irwin said.Andrea Irwin, the teen's mother, said she was so outraged when she heard the announcement that she had to leave the room."I'm heartbroken and I'm angry," she told CNN's Anderson Cooper. "I'm more than upset, almost something that I can't even describe right now."Demonstrators chant near shooting siteAttorney Jon Loevy said the family's investigation into the case is continuing, but he declined to answer questions from reporters about it."We have more questions than you do," he said, "and we don't have answers."Robinson's family supports protests over the case, but stresses they should not be violent, Loevy said."The family feels strongly that protests should not be violent, should be calm," he told reporters. "This is not a situation where people should get hurt or the community should tear itself apart."Ozanne called for calm as he made his highly anticipated announcement."I am concerned that recent violence around our nation is giving some in our communities a justification for fear, hatred and violence," he said. "I am reminded that true and lasting change does not come from violence, but from exercising our voices and our votes."JUST WATCHED No charges filed against cop in death of Tony Robinson Replay More Videos ...

"The environment for healing and reconciliation has been forged, owing to the incredible capacity of the Robinson family and their urging of the community to deal with the issues at hand with responsible activism."Near the site of the March shooting, demonstrators held a large banner Tuesday that said, "BLACK LIVES MATTER" and chanted, "No justice, no peace, no racist police."Prosecutor details investigationAs he revealed his decision, Ozanne noted his own background as the first district attorney of color in the state, then detailed the evidence that led him to the conclusion that Kenny should not be charged."My decision will not bring Tony Robinson Jr. back," Ozanne told reporters. "My decision will not end the racial disparities that exist in the justice system, in our justice system. My decision is not based on emotion. Rather, this decision is based on the facts as they have been investigated and reported to me."Ozanne's announcement came after state authorities investigated the shooting. That's because of a Wisconsin law that requires officer-involved killings to be investigated by officials from outside the law enforcement agency employing the officer involved in the death. A summary of findings from that investigation was also released on Tuesday.The district attorney detailed the series of three 911 calls dispatchers received on March 6 before Kenny arrived at the scene, toxicology results and Kenny's account of what happened that day.Toxicology reports confirmed that Robinson had taken hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana and Xanax before the shooting, the district attorney said, and 911 calls reported that he was acting "insane" and attacking people.JUST WATCHED Why was Tony Robinson shot?

"They have done a smear campaign against my child and against me since this all began."According to the Wisconsin State Journal, Robinson's friends and family members have said he took hallucinogenic mushrooms and was behaving erratically the day he was killed. They reject the idea that Robinson was a threat to Kenny when he was shot, the newspaper reported.Robinson's uncle Turin Carter said in March that family members trusted state investigators to handle the case "with integrity."JUST WATCHED Uncle of victim: 'This was an individual act' Replay More Videos ...

That status will continue, the police chief said Tuesday, while the department completes an internal policy review of the incident.Previous incidents drew attentionBoth Kenny and Robinson had incidents in their past that attracted attention after the shooting.JUST WATCHED Wisconsin shooting is not officer's first Replay More Videos ...
