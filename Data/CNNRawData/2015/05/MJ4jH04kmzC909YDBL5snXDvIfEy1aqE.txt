A 62-year-old who posts images of his ailing mother with her pooch in one Facebook post and raunchy sex jokes in the next.A man who poses alongside his son, middle finger to the air, then lauds his work with special needs children and extols the blessing of healthy grandchildren.Much like the black-and-white goatee he has been rocking since at least 2013, Marty Lewis represents a dichotomy.Lewis is one of the 170 bikers arrested and charged with engaging in organized criminal activity after a brawl and shootout at a Waco, Texas, restaurant left nine bikers dead . He remained in the McLennan County Jail on Wednesday with many of his biker brethren, unable to post the $1 million bail set by a judge.The chaos in Waco began when motorcycle gangs converged on the Twin Peaks restaurant for a Sunday meeting and an uninvited gang showed up, police say. An altercation spilled from the bathroom to the bar to the patio to the parking lot as the bikers beat, stabbed and shot each other before turning their weapons on law enforcement, according to police.Just over a decade ago, Lewis could have been the one putting folks in cuffs.He was a detective and worked in the vice unit at the San Antonio Police Department for 32 years, retiring in February 2004, according to a police statement."As far as my office is aware, he was a vice detective. Our vice unit primarily investigates prostitution, gambling, and liquor violations. At this point, we don't have info that he was ever assigned to infiltrate a gang," San Antonio police spokesman Sgt. Javier Salazar told CNN.Word that a former man in blue was among those arrested didn't sit well with Waco Police Sgt. W. Patrick Swanton."When I heard that this morning, it made me sick to my stomach," Swanton said.But he said there's no doubt that the bikers who are now behind bars knew they were up to no good."Honest citizens don't hide ... weapons inside a restaurant that range anywhere from assaultive type knives, to handguns, to an AK-47 and body armor. And your law-abiding citizen doesn't throw firearms into a bag of tortilla chips," he said. "A law-abiding citizen isn't going to hide a firearm or a knife in between bags of flour. A law-abiding citizen isn't going to go into a restroom and try and stuff handguns in toilets. That happened inside Twin Peaks Sunday."Police have not announced the gangs involved in the deadly violence, but it's been widely reported that the Bandidos and Cossacks were the principal participants in the shootout. While the U.S. Justice Department casts the Bandidos as a criminal enterprise involved in drug production and trafficking, longtime member Jimmy Graves told CNN that isn't the caseJUST WATCHED Bandidos' history of criminal activity Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Bandidos' history of criminal activity 02:43"We are not a gang. We do not do gang things. We are not affiliated with gangs," he said.Older photos on Lewis' Facebook page show him wearing the logos of Texas' Los Patrons Motorcycle Club with a few Bandidos patches, such as the acronym S.Y.L.B., short for "support your local Bandidos."At some point in 2014, he traded in that black leather vest with the braided trim for a suede, button-up vest bearing only the trademark red-and-yellow patches of the Bandidos.His most recent images show him in another black vest with red trim and red-and-yellow patches, including one that says "Valerosos," the Spanish plural for brave, and another that says, "FTW," which can mean "forever two wheels" or "f*** the world."His likes on Facebook include motorcycle outfitters and other clubs, and he boasts dozens of friends posing alongside their choppers or using Bandidos logos as their profile images. Many have blacked out their profile images in what appears to be a response to the deadly Waco shootout.Lewis talks on Facebook about being a 1%er. Some say it is a reference to a decades-old American Motorcycle Association assertion that 99% of bikers were law-abiding and family-oriented, but the AMA disputes ever making the statement. Other self-proclaimed 1%ers say it simply signifies a nonconformist attitude toward society.Photos: Mugshots: Texas biker shootout Photos: Mugshots: Texas biker shootout A fight broke out among rival biker gangs in Waco, Texas, on Sunday, May 17, leaving at least nine people dead. At least 170 people were arrested, and they all face charges of engaging in organized crime. McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara said that bond was being set at $1 million for each of them.

We live our lives without excuses and give respect where it is earned. You can say anything you want about us as long as it's the truth."Alongside the selfies at Bandidos shindigs -- many with Lewis shooting birds at the camera -- and the jokes about boozing, masturbation and sex toys are plenty of posts about family and Christmas, including one about how the Temptations' rendition of " 'Silent Night' takes a brother back." He also jokes about a 16-cent check he received from his Harley-Davidson stock holdings."Drinks on me," he quipped.He also posted several photos of his mom, some in which she's cuddling her beloved dog and another in which she's decked out in Bandidos regalia, and days later added an image of an elderly white woman showing off her "f*** the police" chest tattoo.In February 2014, he thanked his friends who had texted or called with "words of comfort" after his mom's death a few days earlier."Mom I Love You and I'll finish by say'n Well Done," he wrote.In October, responding to a woman sharing the news that her daughter had just had a baby, he shared a warm congratulations."That is a bless'n," he wrote. "I work with special need kids everyday and folk don't know how lucky they are to have healthy children...These kids just warm your heart and makes me realize that I'm so lucky to have had all my kids and grands born healthy."
