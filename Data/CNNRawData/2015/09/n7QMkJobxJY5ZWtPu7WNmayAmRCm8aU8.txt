Story highlights Judge voids sentence of teen who was jailed and on sex offender registryTeen had sex with 14-year-old who lied about her age(CNN) A judge has voided the original sentence of an Indiana teenager who had been sent to jail and placed on his state's sexual offender registry after having sex with a young teen he met on a dating app. Zach Anderson had consensual sex with a girl from a nearby town who had told the boy she was 17 when in reality she was only 14.In a ruling signed on September 3, a Michigan judge ruled that the prosecutor in the original case "did not fulfill and significantly undercut the plea agreement" and that the agreement was "breached" and accordingly Anderson's original sentence was vacated. Anderson will be re-sentenced, and both his father and attorney said they hope Anderson will be taken off the sex offender registry.Under the terms of the initial plea agreement, the prosecutor said that he would not "recommend nor oppose" Anderson's request to keep the case off his permanent record. But during the sentencing, the prosecutor said Anderson's case was just like that of two other defendants, who were denied the request to keep their records clean. "They should all probably be treated the same way," he said, "there is no difference between this gentleman (and) the two that have been before this Court, between the victims and the other victims in the community."The judge who ruled that statement was a breach of the plea agreement, Dennis Wiley, is the same one who told Anderson in court that there was "no excuse whatsoever" for what the teenager did."That seems to be the culture now. Meet. Have sex, sayonara. Totally inappropriate behavior," the judge said during the original sentencing. And he took another swipe at Anderson today saying the girl appeared to be "obviously underage, developmentally and emotionally immature and easily manipulated" by Anderson.Read More
