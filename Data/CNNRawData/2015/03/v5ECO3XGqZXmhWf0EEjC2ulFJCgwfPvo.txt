Norman, Oklahoma (CNN) A racist chant from the University of Oklahoma's now-disbanded Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity is part of a "horrible cancer" that entered the chapter three to four years ago, local alumni advisers said Wednesday.The board of trustees for SAE at the university said its members are "sincerely remorseful" for the actions of fraternity brothers seen in a racist nine-second video that went viral over the weekend."The OU SAE Board of Trustees has discovered that a horrible cancer entered into the OU chapter of SAE three to four years ago and was not immediately and totally stopped. It should have been," the organization said in a written statement.The chant was discovered by the school newspaper and a student organization, which received the clip via anonymous messages.The video shows party-bound students on a bus clapping, pumping their fists and laughing as they chant , "There will never be a ni**** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me. There will never be a ni**** SAE."The university cut ties with Sigma Alpha Epsilon after the video surfaced, as did the national fraternity.Parker Rice and Levi Pettit were expelled Tuesday over their alleged "leadership role" in the chant, a decision President David Boren attributed to his school's zero tolerance policy for racist behavior.Rice said he is seeking guidance to ensure it doesn't happen again."I am deeply sorry for what I did Saturday night. It was wrong and reckless," Rice said Tuesday in a statement to The Dallas Morning News."I made a horrible mistake by joining into the singing and encouraging others to do the same."Rice said he was taught the chant.A statement from Pettit's parents said their son made a horrible mistake. They apologized to the "entire African-American community," students and university faculty."He is a good boy, but what we saw in those videos is disgusting. While it may be difficult for those who only know Levi from the video to understand, we know his heart, and he is not a racist," Brody and Susan Pettit said.CNN has reached out to both students, but has not heard back. A spokesman for the Pettit family confirmed that Levi Pettit was in the video but has declined CNN's request for an interview.JUST WATCHED Fraternity spokesman: Racist chant 'disgusting' Replay More Videos ...

The problem is not just a couple of guys on that bus, the problem is that house, it's a cancer that needs to be cut out."The fraternity said it is investigating other incidents involving other chapters that were brought to the attention of its national office."I was not only shocked and disappointed but disgusted by the outright display of racism displayed in the video," said Brad Cohen, the fraternity's national president .

"There seems to be a culture in some of these fraternities, and it just has to be snuffed out."
