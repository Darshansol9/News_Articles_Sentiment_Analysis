He's still in a Nevada hospital fighting for his life. Even his publicity-loving ex-in-laws, the Kardashians, are tight-lipped, posting nothing but photos of Odom from happier times on social media. What we did learn yesterday was that Odom dropped a boatload of money at the Love Ranch, the Crystal, Nevada, brothel where he was found unconscious earlier this week. Odom spent $75,000 there, the price that guaranteed two women would "take care of any of his needs."JUST WATCHED Odom spent $75K at brothel Replay More Videos ...
