Lively studied the fossil as part of his master's thesis at the University of Utah.A team of scientists uncovered a new species of extinct turtle in southern Utah that features bizarre anatomy including a pig-like snout.The discovery is significant because most fossil remains of ancient turtle species consist of a skull or shell, but rarely the two together. This new specimen includes not only the skull and the shell, but also a nearly complete forelimb, partial hindlimbs, and vertebrae from the neck and tail of Arvinachelys.Read More
