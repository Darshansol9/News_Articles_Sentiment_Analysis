Story highlights Concrete Jungle picks fresh produce in industrialized areas and provides it to homeless shelters and food banksIt started with friends who had apples left over from a party, and it has now mapped more than 2,500 fruit trees in the metropolitan Atlanta areaConcrete Jungle plans to expand to other metropolitan cities across the United StatesAtlanta (CNN) A single cider press and large quantities of apples may seem to portray an autumn harvest day at a farm, but they're the inspiration for Concrete Jungle, a nonprofit organization in Atlanta that's providing fresh produce to the city's homeless population.Several years ago, after Craig Durkin, Aubrey Daniels and their friends received a cider press, they decided to pick apples around the city and host a cider pressing party. Each year, the party grew in size, as did the amount of fruit they picked.Then in 2009, when Katherine Kennedy, now the director of Concrete Jungle, said they had too many apples left over, they realized they could put that fruit to good use."We should just donate these apples. We should start by picking fruit to donate and then have a cider party at the end of year," she said. "So basically, it was a group of friends that noticed how much fruit was around the city."The friends donated the extra fruit to a local homeless shelter, and Concrete Jungle was born. Its mission is to provide fresh local produce to area homeless shelters and food banks.Read More
