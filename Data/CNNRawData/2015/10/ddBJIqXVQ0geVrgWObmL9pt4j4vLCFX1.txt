(CNN) Kyle Navin has been charged in the murder of his parents Jeffrey and Jeannette Navin, Connecticut State Police said.The Navins, of Easton, went missing in early August, just days after losing an appeal in a multimillion dollar foreclosure case.Navin, 27, has been charged with two counts of murder and two counts of murder with special circumstances.His girlfriend, Jennifer Valiante, of Westport, Connecticut, was also charged Friday, with conspiracy to commit murder and hindering prosecution.Navin is being held on a $2.5 million bond, Valiante on a $2 million bond.Kyle Navins' parents were last seen August 4 at the trash removal and recycling company that they own in Easton, Connecticut.On Friday, human remains found in a vacant lot less than 10 miles away were positively identified as the missing couple, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said.Gun charge hearingKyle Navin appeared at a detention hearing for an unrelated gun charge on Friday and a federal prosecutor said then that he could face murder charges in the disappearance of his parents, according to Tom Carson, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Connecticut. A judge ordered Friday that he be kept in custody.He had been arrested and charged September 8 with "possession of a firearm by an individual who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance," according to federal court records.Navin's lawyer, Eugene Riccio, has not returned calls seeking comment on his client's case.Deserted houseThe possible break in the case came Thursday afternoon when the owner of a property on Norfield Road called police about the find at a house that had not been occupied in years, police said. State police detectives were assisting Weston police in the investigation."They believe that it may be associated with that case," Daubert said, adding that the medical examiner was analyzing the remains.The Weston property is about 9 miles from where the missing couple lived.Daubert said it was "very odd" that remains were found so close to where the couple disappeared."Nobody knows who's there, what's there or what's going on," the property owner, Thomas Kerrigan, told CNN.'Did you hurt mom?'On the day Jeffrey Navin was last seen, he sent a chilling text message to his son: "Did you hurt mom?"Two minutes later, another message from father to son was even more ominous: "I go home and get framed for murder."Four days after they were last seen, police found a blue pickup belonging to the couple in a commuter parking lot off an exit on Merritt Parkway, according to Easton Police Chief Tim Shaw.William Navin, Jeffrey's brother and co-owner of the refuse company, told Easton Police that Jeffrey had not shown up to work, which was highly unusual, the affidavit said. He also said that Kyle was the last to see them.Family members and friends had been trying to call the couple, but their phones appeared to have been turned off, according to William Navin.Law enforcement officers later obtained cell data for the couple, according to the affidavit. Both phones pinged the same cell tower in Bridgeport, Connecticut -- "in the vicinity of (Kyle) Navin's residence," the affidavit said.Police: inconsistent accountsThe same day the Navins were reported missing, law enforcement officers spoke to Kyle, according to the affidavit.Kyle Navin confirmed to police that he saw his parents the morning of August 4 and that they invited him to dinner that evening, but he declined because he was in pain from a back injury, the affidavit said.Authorities interviewed Kyle Navin three more times during a 10-day period. He gave police inconsistent accounts of the interactions he had with his parents the last time that they were seen, the affidavit said.Kyle Navin said he picked up his mother at a parking lot off the Merritt Parkway in his garbage truck, and the two went to collect refuse along his usual route, according to the affidavit. Around 9 a.m. that morning, Kyle's back began to bother him and the two eventually met up with his father so his son could go home.Authorities determined that his varying accounts did not accord with cell phone data, which shows a different travel route for Kyle Navin, according to the affidavit.Cell phone recordsKyle Navin also told authorities he continued to contact his father via telephone that afternoon solely about work and his back injury.But cell phone records reviewed by law enforcement officers show otherwise:"I'm not going home till I know mom is okay... did you hurt mom?" said a text message Jeffrey Navin sent to his son, according to the affidavit."No Absolutely not. Why would you think," Kyle replied."I go home and get framed for murder... I'm going to the police first," the father responded.Just a half hour before Jeffrey Navin's phone is last registered as being used -- at 12:57p.m. -- there was another text message to his son: "U R setting me up."Two hours later, a security camera video also captured Jeffrey Navin's garbage truck being driven toward the couple's home late that afternoon with the car of Kyle's girlfriend following behind, the affidavit said.Nearly 30 minutes later, the girlfriend's car is spotted going in the opposite direction. Kyle Navin's girlfriend later told authorities that Kyle drove his father's truck to their home, she followed him and then drove him back to their residence and "could offer no reason as to why or how Jeffrey's truck came to be in Bridgeport or why Navin needed to drive the truck back to Easton."Firearms seizedDuring a search of at Kyle Navin's residence, officers seized two firearms and numerous rounds of ammunition, as well as hypodermic needles, glassine bags with "what appeared to be heroin residue," empty prescription bottles for Oxycodone and several prescription bottles containing various controlled substances such as Xanax, the affidavit said.Also recovered from the home was a receipt from Home Depot issued on August 5 showing Kyle Navin purchased "germicidal bleach, hair/grease drain opener, 'Goo Gone' stain remover and contractor cleanup bags," the affidavit said.Law enforcement officers also interviewed a person who had previously purchased prescription drugs from Navin, the affidavit said.The unidentified person contacted Kyle Navin on August 5, to purchase Oxycodone, according to the affidavit.The person told law enforcement that Kyle Navin said he was "dealing with a lot of family issues and that it looked like his parents were missing."Kyle Navin previously told authorities that he learned about the "mystery" of his parents' whereabouts when his uncle called him on August 6, 2015, according to the affidavit.
