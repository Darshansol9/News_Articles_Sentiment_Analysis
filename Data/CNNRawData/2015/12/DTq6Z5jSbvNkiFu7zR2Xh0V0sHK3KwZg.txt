Story highlights A Boy Scout troop leader was attacked by a bear after entering a cave off a hiking trailThe three Scouts he was with were not harmedScout leader played dead to trick bear(CNN) A New Jersey Boy Scout troop leader was mauled by a black bear Sunday as he lowered himself into a rock crevice where the animal was likely hibernating, the Rockaway Township Police Department said.The bear bit Christopher Petronino on his shoulders, legs and scalp, according to New Jersey Fish and Wildlife Director Dave Chanda.
