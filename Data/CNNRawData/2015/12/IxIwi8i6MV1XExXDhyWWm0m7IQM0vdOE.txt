In 2015, CNN brought you tales of American extremes: From the town in Alaska where everyone lives in one building to the Virginia hamlet where cell phones are banned to one of the nation's richest places with children living in poverty. You might say these stories bring new meaning to the phrase "American exceptionalism."It's home to Facebook and Apple -- and children living in garages and tent camps. CNN Opinion Columnist John D. Sutter journeyed to California to explore the dichotomy of Silicon Valley, where despite enormous wealth, 23% of children live in poverty. He met kids who'd never been to the rich part of the valley and two parents who worked full-time and were still homeless. He also offered four solutions for ending child poverty in America -- and traveled to places where these ideas have worked.Can you imagine living in a town where cell phones and other wireless devices aren't allowed? Welcome to Green Bank, West Virginia. CNN's Wayne Drash and Evelio Contreras traveled to this town out of time , which one resident calls "the place where you can come to get away from the United States."
