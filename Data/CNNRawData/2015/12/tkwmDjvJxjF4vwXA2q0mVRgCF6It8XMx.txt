(CNN) Years before police said she intentionally drove onto a Las Vegas Strip sidewalk , killing one person and injuring 37 others, Lakeisha Holloway was publicly honored for turning her life around.On Tuesday, she was formally charged with murder with a deadly weapon and with one count of leaving the scene of an accident, also a felony, according to a criminal complaint. She faces a third felony, which is child abuse, neglect or endangerment, in connection with her small child's presence in the car.More charges are expected as the investigation unfolds, prosecutors said Tuesday.Just three years ago, Holloway spoke of how her life was taking a turn for the better."Boy, have I come a long ways," Holloway said in a 2012 video by the Portland Opportunities Industrialization Center , which helps at-risk youth with education and career training."I was a scared little girl who knew that there was more to life outside of crime, drug addiction, lower income, alcoholism, being undereducated -- all of which I grew up being familiar with."Thanks to the nonprofit, she went from homelessness to a job with the federal government and "living the grand life."Lakeisha N. HollowayBut now, the 24-year-old faces serious charges after allegedly plowing into dozens of pedestrians with her 3-year-old daughter inside her car.What would cause a woman who showed so much promise to do something so savage, as police claim?"She would not explain why she drove onto the sidewalk but remembered a body bouncing off of her windshield, breaking it," authorities said in her arrest report.Changing her name to Paris Paradise MortonClark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson indicated more charges are likely."Our hearts go out to the victims and their families," the prosecutor said in a statement. "This is a horrendous and inexcusable act that has needlessly and tragically impacted countless lives. I am confident that, as the investigation unfolds, we will be filing many more charges against Ms. Holloway."Under a new state law that went into effect October 1, leaving an accident scene where an injury occurred is now punishable by up to 20 years in prison and is non-probational, the prosecutor said.In October, Holloway legally changed her name to Paris Paradise Morton, according to a court judgment in Oregon. Authorities, however, have continued to identify her by her former name.Homeless againClark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said it's not clear what may have caused Holloway to "snap."JUST WATCHED Las Vegas driver to be charged with murder Replay More Videos ...

The representative declined to comment on what could have prompted the incident.The sheriff said police don't know what "caused her to snap and/or whether it was planned previously."Holloway told authorities that before the crash, she had been trying to rest or sleep in her car with her daughter, but kept getting run off by security at the places wherever she stopped, according to her arrest report.She wound up on the Strip, "a place she did not want to be," the police statement read. Police said she told them she wasn't under the influence of drugs or alcohol.Witnesses said Holloway was driving down Las Vegas Boulevard before her car jumped onto the sidewalk and started striking pedestrians.She allegedly drove the 1996 Oldsmobile sedan with Oregon plates onto the sidewalk at different spots. She careened onto the sidewalk at least three or four times, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Deputy Chief Brett Zimmerman said.Holloway then left the scene and drove about a mile before driving onto the property of another hotel and contacting a security officer, asking that officer to call the police because she'd just hit several people, according to the arrest report.Driver 'just kept mowing people down'JUST WATCHED Witness: I saw some bodies just flying in the air Replay More Videos ...

Role Model Award in 2012, expressed shock over her arrest."She was such a great kid while she was a part of our program," one of the youth employment staff members said, according to a POIC statement.In her 2012 video, Holloway said she was homeless in high school and nearly failing all her classes.But she graduated with a B+ average, went on to college and started working with the U.S. Forest Service."Today, I am not the same scared girl I used to be," she said in the video. "I'm a mature young woman who has broken many generational cycle(s) that those before me hadn't."
