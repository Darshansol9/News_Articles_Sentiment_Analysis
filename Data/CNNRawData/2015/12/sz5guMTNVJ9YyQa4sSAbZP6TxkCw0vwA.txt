Find co-workers, church members or friends who have no holiday plans and invite them over. You can take pictures and post them on your new blog. Look on Pinterest to find great ideas for your party.4. Visit a veteran's hospitalMany of the men and women who have served our country will mark the holiday alone and in the hospital. Honor their service and say thank you in person during a visit to a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital. Many patients are on fixed incomes and unable to buy items that could make their recoveries better. Check with the hospital, but things like magazines, coffee, cookies or gently used clothing are needed.
