Story highlights Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl says he is satisfied with his counsel; new judge assigned to caseBergdahl speaks sparsely during hearing, doesn't indicate preference for bench or jury trialTaliban captured Bergdahl in 2009; he was released last year in swap for Guantanamo detaineesFort Bragg, North Carolina (CNN) Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl was arraigned Tuesday on charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy during a hearing preceding his court-martial at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.Sporting a shaved head and a blue military dress uniform, Bergdahl did not enter a plea and did not indicate a preference for a jury or bench trial. He showed little expression and looked straight ahead during the hearing.Col. Christopher Frederikson, the judge in the case, explained that if Bergdahl opted against a bench trial, he would face a panel of at least five officers, all ranked higher than the sergeant. If the jury found Bergdahl guilty and elected to sentence him to more than 10 years in prison, it would require a three-fourths vote via secret ballot, the judge said.The majority of Berghdahl's public comments consisted of "Sir, yes, sir," in response to Frederikson's questions. He also whispered occasionally to Lt. Col. Franklin D. Rosenblatt, one of his attorneys. In one of the few decisions to come out of Tuesday's hearing, Bergdahl told Frederikson he was pleased with his military and civilian counsel.About 50 people, an even split of journalists and military personnel, attended the 11-minute proceeding, and then Bergdahl exited the courtroom with two military escorts and Rosenblatt. Bergdahl said hello to one reporter, but for the most part, did not make eye contact with the press corps.Read More
