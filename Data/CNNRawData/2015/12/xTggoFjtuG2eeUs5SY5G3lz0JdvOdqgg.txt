Story highlights Seattle released extensive video, details about a fatal encounter between police and an armed manSan Francisco's mayor says U.S. "has seen far too many incidents" like the one in his city that ended in a man's deathThese cities' moves come after Chicago faced criticism for its actions following Laquan McDonald's death(CNN) For 13 months, the Chicago Police Department had dashcam video showing one of its officers shooting Laquan McDonald but didn't release it. That finally did happen, though only after a court mandate.But it doesn't always play out this way when a city's police department shoots and kills a citizen.That was evident this week in two West Coast cities, Seattle and San Francisco, where authorities were proactive following deadly officer-involved shootings. In one case, dashcam videos and a detailed narrative emerged almost immediately. In the other, officials made several changes right away and pushed for others -- all in the spirit of preventing such a thing from happening again."This country has seen far too many incidents where conflicts between police and young men of color result in the death of a young person," San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee said Monday, after outlining what his city would and should do differently. "... We're not this kind of city. That's not our values."There are plenty of valid reasons for authorities, be they elected officials like Lee or law enforcement leaders, not to do too much, too quickly after a police officer kills in the line of duty. One fear is that releasing too much information will taint the potential jury pool; another often cited reason, as in Chicago, is that doing so could undermine ongoing investigations.
