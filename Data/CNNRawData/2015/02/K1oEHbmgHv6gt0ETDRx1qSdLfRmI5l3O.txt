MUST WATCH FBI: Three men attempted to join ISIS 03:08Saidakhmetov said he couldn't afford a direct flight, which would have cost $900, so the travel agent booked him a trip connecting in Kiev, Ukraine, for $571.At the time, the travel agent said, he saw "nothing out of the ordinary."Saidakhmetov purchased the tickets using a New York state ID, the travel agent said.The landlord of the Brooklyn apartment building where Saidakhmetov and Juraboev lived said the 19-year-old recently told him he was about to take a long vacation.Court documents say Saidakhmetov once posted some comments on video of ISIS executing Iraqi forces."Allahu akbar (God is great). I was very happy after reading this, my eyes joyful so much victory."The criminal complaint says he told a confidential informant that he wanted to travel to Syria to wage jihad, "but that his mother had feared that he would do so and took his passport so that he could not travel."JUST WATCHED Three arrested after allegedly attempting to join ISIS Replay More Videos ...

We will go and purchase one handgun ... then go and shoot one police officer. Boom. ... Then, we will take his gun, bullets and bulletproof vest ... then, we will do the same with a couple of others. Then we will go to the FBI headquarters, kill the FBI people."Abdurasul JuraboevJuraboev is a 24-year-old citizen of Uzbekistan. Like Saidakhmetov, he is a legal permanent resident of the United States.Court documents say he's also known as Abdulloh ibn Hasan.Before his arrest at his Brooklyn home, Juraboev was scheduled to hop a flight to Turkey, the criminal complaint said.He worked at the Gyro King restaurant in Brooklyn and had asked for the weekend off so he could travel. He would arrive at work around noon daily, wearing headphones and greeting co-workers as he made his delivery of lettuce, tomatoes and onions, according to a co-worker named Saad, who described the suspect as quiet and "just a normal guy."Zak Kahn, owner of Gyro King, said Juraboev was quiet and not given to discussing politics."I never heard him -- not even a single sentence -- (talk) about politics, about jihad, about army, about military or force... What happened to him? He seemed to be a very peaceful person."Kahn said Juraboev told him about a month ago that he was returning to the homeland."He became even more alone," he told CNN on Thursday, adding that Juraboev seemed more detached and wore his headphones most of the time.On February 21, Juraboev sent his employer a text message: "Brother I want to leave my country next weekend. Because I have some problem. Is it possible or not? Sorry!"JUST WATCHED Expert: Wannabe terrorists don't have to be smart Replay More Videos ...

We too wanted to pledge our allegiance and commit ourselves while not present there," Juraboev is said to have posted."I am in USA now but we don't have any arms. But is it possible to commit ourselves as dedicated martyrs anyway while here? What I'm saying is, to shoot Obama and then get shot ourselves, will it do? That will strike fear in the hearts of infidels."The post earned Juraboev a visit from federal agents several days later.Juraboev admitted that he'd posted the message and that he believed in the ISIS agenda.He also said "that he would harm Obama if he had the opportunity to do so, but currently does not have the means or an imminent plan to do so," the complaint says.In intercepted online communication to a pro-ISIS website, Juraboev said his parents were in Uzbekistan."Sometimes they worship and practice Islam, sometimes they do idolatry," he said, according to the complaint. "My sisters are uncovered, lack knowledge of a religion. I wish they knew at least how to cover themselves up."The administrator encouraged him to join the fight. Juraboev said he's worried about being caught, the court documents say.
