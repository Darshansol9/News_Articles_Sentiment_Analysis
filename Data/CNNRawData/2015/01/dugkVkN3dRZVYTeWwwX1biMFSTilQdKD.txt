(CNN) Sgt. Jennifer Bruno knew the blizzard battering New England might be brutal.So as the storm hit, she spent Monday night at a friend's house. When she returned to her coastal home in Marshfield, Massachusetts, Tuesday, she discovered a devastating scene.Rocks were everywhere, she said."Part of the roof collapsed, the wall, my door was missing," she told CNN's AC360. "It was just destroyed."The Massachusetts National Guard sergeant and Iraq war veteran cried when she caught the first glimpse of what happened. Then she went back inside to get her uniforms, a sword she got in Iraq and a cross with scripture on it that once hung on her wall."I've been through a lot, and that was just more than I thought would have happened," she said. "(I'll) just take it one day at a time."As crews started surveying storm damage and clearing streets, officials warned that the potential for record-setting snowfall remains as stormy weather wallops New England. But Bruno and other residents of coastal areas faced another more menacing threat: storm surge flooding.'We're not out of this yet'In Boston, where about 2 feet of snow had fallen, the city's mayor said there was still work to be done."We're not out of this yet. We're trying to get ahead of it," Mayor Marty Walsh said. "We just keep plowing."The hardest-hit area -- Auburn, Massachuetts -- got 32.5 inches of snow. And it hasn't stopped yet."This is a very significant storm, and in many parts of Massachusetts, I think, you could call it, in fact, a historic event," Gov. Charlie Baker told reporters.Photos: Massive storm hammers Northeast Photos: Massive storm hammers Northeast Dexter Newcomb begins cleanup at his house in Scituate, Massachusetts, on Wednesday, January 28, a day after a winter storm left his neighborhood coated in frozen sea spray and sand.

Businesses closed, suggesting a far-reaching economic impact in one of America's busiest commercial regions.But by midmorning, snow wasn't even falling in New York City. By then, travel bans in New Jersey and New York -- even places like Long Island's Islip, which got more than 20 inches of snow -- had been lifted.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called all the warning and preparations "a better-safe-than-sorry scenario.""We've dodged the bullet," he said. "This is nothing like we feared it would be."But for some in the state, the storm proved dangerous.A 17-year-old died after he hit something while snow-tubing Monday night in Huntington, New York, Suffolk County's Tim Sini said.

That's hardly a dusting, but it's also not surprising when you live in New England."Sure, that's a lot, but I have tons of family in Buffalo and they were dealing with 6-10 feet of (snow) at the start of the season," Robins said. "...We will weather this like the New Englanders we are."
