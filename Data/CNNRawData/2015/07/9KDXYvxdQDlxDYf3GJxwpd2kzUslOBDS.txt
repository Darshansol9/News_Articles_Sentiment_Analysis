"Please look around July 4th gatherings -- block parties, cookouts, town fireworks displays -- and consider whether a child whom you would have expected to see there is now not present."The child's body was discovered June 25 along the shores of Deer Island, a narrow peninsula just east of Boston's Logan Airport.
