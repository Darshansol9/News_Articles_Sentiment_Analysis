(CNN) The killing last week of a San Francisco woman , allegedly by an undocumented immigrant with a felony record, has put the spotlight on the city's policy of refusing to honor federal requests to hold on to people found to be in the country illegally.San Francisco authorities released suspect Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez in April after dropping the drug charges on which they had asked federal authorities to turn him over -- even though federal officials had asked the city to let them know if they were going to cut him loose.The city, however, doesn't honor such immigration detention requests under its 26-year-old sanctuary law.San Francisco is one of dozens of cities, counties and states across the country that have laws, policies or regulations that prevent employees from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts.Here's some information about sanctuary cities and the debate surrounding them:What is a sanctuary city?There's no legal definition of a sanctuary city, county or state, and what it means varies from place to place. But jurisdictions that fall under that controversial term -- supporters oppose it -- generally have policies or laws that limit the extent to which law enforcement and other government employees will go to assist the federal government on immigration matters.Some communities use nonbinding resolutions, executive orders, police department policies or orders, while others use laws to enforce such policies, according to the Congressional Research ServiceIn San Francisco, for instance, a 1989 law called the City and County of Refuge ordinance prohibits city employees from helping federal immigration enforcement efforts unless compelled by court order or state law.JUST WATCHED San Francisco shooting spurs immigration debate Replay More Videos ...

"We're a world-renowned city with a large immigrant population. ... From a law enforcement perspective, we want to build trust with that population."JUST WATCHED SF sheriff defends sanctuary city policy Replay More Videos ...

"They think that cooperating with ICE causes them problems with respect to the immigrant community and public safety, but in fact it does exactly the opposite, as we've seen here."Such policies "ignore the fact that if the illegal aliens were removed from the U.S., they would not be here to become victims, and the predators would be out of the country, too," Ohio Jobs & Justice PAC, which opposes sanctuary policies, says on its website."Sanctuary policies -- official or otherwise, result in safe havens (or safer havens) for illegal aliens involved in a variety of criminal enterprises -- since their illegal schemes are less likely to be uncovered and face less risk of deportation if caught by local law enforcement," the website says."Sanctuary policies also provide an environment helpful to Latin American drug cartels, gangs, and terrorist cells -- since their activities are less likely to be detected and reported by law enforcement."Some Republican presidential candidates have used similar language. Donald Trump has blamed immigration policy for Kate Steinle 's death. Another Republican, Jeb Bush, agreed, saying such policies encourage such crimes.What has the federal government said?In March, Saldana, the ICE director, drew heat from immigrant rights supporters after appearing at a congressional hearing to endorse efforts to rein in the sanctuary movement.In written testimony submitted to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Saldana said that a significant factor affecting efforts to deport undocumented immigrants "has been the increase in state and local jurisdictions that are limiting their partnership, or wholly refusing to cooperate, with ICE immigration enforcement efforts.""While the reasons for this may vary, including state and local legislative restrictions and judicial findings of state and local liability, in certain circumstances we believe less cooperation may increase the risk that dangerous criminals are returned to the streets, putting the public and our officers at greater risk," she said.During questioning, she was asked if she would support a new federal law mandating local cooperation."Thank you, amen," Saldana reportedly answered, according to media reports.That stance quickly drew the attention of critics such the American Civil Liberties Union, which said in a blog post that Saldana's comments "insulted all the states and localities across the country who have wisely decided to stay out of immigration enforcement."She quickly issued a statement saying that any such legislation would "be a highly counterproductive step and lead to more resistance and less cooperation in our overall efforts to promote public safety."What's next?It's sure to become a point of discussion on the presidential campaign trail, in local elections and among the professional debating corps, but given the complexities of the issue and decades of difficulty reaching any consensus on the issue, it's far less certain the incident will result in any widespread changes.
