Story highlights Geologists predict that a powerful earthquake could hit the San Francisco Bay AreaThere is no good way to predict when a quake will strikeEarthquakes on the Hayward Fault usually happen every 90 to 140 years(CNN) There's a big earthquake coming.Tuesday's magnitude-4.0 earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area caused relatively little damage, but it gave a glimpse of the potential geological threats the region could face.Scientists believe there's strong evidence to suggest that a major quake will strike the San Francisco Bay Area; the only question is when.Geophysicist Tom Brocher with the U.S. Geological Survey said scientists are confident that a major earthquake will happen on the Hayward Fault Zone, a 74-mile-long fault line that runs along the the east side of the Bay Area, near cities such as Oakland and Fremont.The zone is known for destructive earthquakes.
