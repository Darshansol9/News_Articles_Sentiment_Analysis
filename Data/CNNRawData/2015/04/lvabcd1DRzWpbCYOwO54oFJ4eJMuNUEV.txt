(CNN) About two dozen students at an Indiana high school were hurt Thursday evening when the stage they were performing on collapsed.The students at Westfield High School were performing in a school concert. All of the injured were on stage and transported to several local area hospitals, according to Capt. Charles Hollowell of the Westfield Police Department. One of the students was critically injured.Westfield, a city about 25 miles north of Indianapolis, had about 75 students in a production called "American Pie," says Westfield-Washington school official Chris Baldwin. A video of the incident obtained by CNN shows a few students on a platform performing, who are then joined by many other students coming on stage dancing, which resulted in the collapse into what looked to be a pit. Immediately following the collapse, audience members are heard screaming and some are seen rushing towards the stage area.An investigation is ongoing and the high school will be open Friday.
