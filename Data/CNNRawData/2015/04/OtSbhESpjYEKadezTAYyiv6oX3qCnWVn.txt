"It's kind of one of your little greasy spoon restaurants," said Eric Widick, who drove up in his truck to help out."We're a community. If one person is in need, we'll all be there for them."People were inside when the storm quashed Grubsteakers and turned over a semitruck parked outside. No one was killed or seriously injured, Widick said. A patron who found shelter in a restroom was trapped inside for about half an hour.People had been eating at Grubsteakers for some 25 years and will miss it, Widick said.In Rochelle, the tornado flattened some of the homes of Olson's friends.A safe distance away from it, at her mother's house, she had to think about her husband, Chet, who was re-elected mayor of the town of about 10,000 people the previous day.

On Thursday, the storm took his house and his sister-in-law's. "I've got the clothes on my back," he said.On Friday, VanVickle attended a news conference with Rauner, who praised the sheriff."He's been serving around the clock -- along with his entire team -- with no sleep," the governor said. "Thank you for your service."It was the first tornado VanVickle had ever seen in his county."I've lived here all my life, am the fifth generation in the county. My mom said this is the first time she's ever seen a tornado."He said he is thankful the National Weather Service warned one could come. Sirens provided residents with 27 minutes of lead time. That saved lives, he said."We didn't have a single fatality in the county," said VanVickle, standing in front of the ruins that were once his home. "You count your blessings and you thank God -- even though you see what's behind you -- thank God that everybody's safe."For the time being, VanVickle and his family will stay with relatives."The nice part is we live in the Midwest and everyone takes care of their own," he said.The weather service warned of a "particularly dangerous situation." People across the Midwest should be on alert for severe weather. Tornado watches ran out early Friday. Severe thunderstorms are possible Friday afternoon or evening from parts of the mid-Atlantic region to the Gulf Coast states.
