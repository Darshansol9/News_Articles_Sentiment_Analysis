IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL: President Obama got the framework for a nuclear deal with Iran that he wanted, earned after tough negotiations with foes. Now for the President comes the harder part: Selling it to friends. Congress (including many of Obama's fellow Democrats) may try to block the deal by imposing new sanctions on Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyau blasted the agreement and vowed his country would do what it could to scuttle it. And Saudi Arabia, another nation in the region friendly with the U.S., may get its own nukes if it feels the deal won't stop Iran from developing them. Lots more heavy lifting to do before the June 30 deadline for a final agreement.
