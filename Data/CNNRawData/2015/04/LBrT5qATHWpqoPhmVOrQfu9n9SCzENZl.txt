(CNN) The parents of the youngest victim of the Boston Marathon bombings are making an emotional, passionate plea to take the death penalty off the table for the man convicted in the case.Last week, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found guilty on all 30 charges he faced related to the bombings at the 2013 race and the dramatic violence that dragged out for days afterward.It is expected to last four weeks.In a front-page opinion piece in The Boston Globe , Bill and Denise Richard wrote about the toll taken on their family after the death of their 8-year-old son, MartinThe Richard family before the tragedy: Mother Denise, father Bill, Martin, older brother Henry and sister Jane.Their daughter, Jane, also was severely injured."Our family has grieved, buried our young son, battled injuries, and endured numerous surgeries -- all while trying to rebuild lives that will never be the same," they said in the Globe column titled "To end the anguish, drop the death penalty.""We sat in the courtroom, day after day, bearing witness to overwhelming evidence that included graphic video and photographs, replicated bombs, and even the clothes our son wore his last day alive."They said they understood the "heinousness and brutality of the crimes committed.""We were there. We lived it. The defendant murdered our 8-year-old son, maimed our 7-year-old daughter, and stole part of our soul."JUST WATCHED Survivor: I won't lose sleep over him being put to death Replay More Videos ...

We hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering, painful reminder of what the defendant took from them, which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring."Photos: Nation mourns Boston bombing victims Photos: Nation mourns Boston bombing victims Three people were killed when two homemade explosives went off at the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013, and a campus police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was fatally shot in the manhunt that followed.
