Ferguson, Missouri (CNN) After months of tension and protests, Ferguson residents go to the polls Tuesday to elect three new members of City Council. Even though Ferguson is about 70% black, five of six council seats are held by whites.That will change in this election: Two black men are running for one of the open seats, and the current lone black council member isn't up for re-election. In another ward, two black women and two white men are vying for an open seat. And a white protester is running for a third post.Depending on turnout, the council could end up with three black members and a white guy who protested on the streets after Michael Brown's death last August.CNN's Moni Basu recently walked the streets of the beleaguered city and asked people what their priorities were for Ferguson moving forward.
