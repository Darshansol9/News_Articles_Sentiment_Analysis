I'm ready to take on the world, actually," she told CNN's Poppy Harlow.Tsarnaev could face the death penalty."I really don't feel strongly one way or the other" about which punishment he gets, says fellow survivor Heather Abbott."Regardless of what happens, you know, I'm not going to get my leg back, and the people who lost their loved ones aren't going to get those people back either. ... I think it will be nice to be able to move on once it's finished."Both Daniel and Abbott planned to cheer on the runners Monday.Among those killed in the 2013 double bombing was 8-year-old Martin Richard.On Monday, his former teacher ran the marathon in his memory for the second year in a row."I had to run," said Nikolas Franks, who is now part of a foundation in the boy's memory"The emotional sort of counseling that I went through, the therapy just in running, it was important for me," he told CNN affiliate WHDH.Franks also taught Martin's sister, who lost her leg in the attack."The whole family -- they're really amazing people," he said. "And it's interesting that he's (Martin's) become sort of a beacon of peace because he was a beacon of peace in our classroom."Since im a #runner i had to #repost this! In support of the #2015 #bostonmarathon today! #bostonstrong #boston A photo posted by The Wellness Sanctuary Inc (@thewellnesssanctuaryinc) on Apr 20, 2015 at 6:56am PDTCNN national security analyst Juliette Kayyem says that as the "runners begin and, hopefully, finish their exhausting run Monday, the lingering memories of the 2013 marathon blasts will be seen and felt in all sorts of ways."In a column for CNN.com , she wrote that the trial's "simplicity not only vindicated the capacity of our constitutional system to handle these cases, but also took the mythology (maybe even the romanticism) of terrorism out of the case. It rendered Tsarnaev a common criminal. And that was a statement worth making."
