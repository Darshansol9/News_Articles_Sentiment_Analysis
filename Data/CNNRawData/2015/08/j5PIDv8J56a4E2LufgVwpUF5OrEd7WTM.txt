(CNN) About 200 active duty military personnel will help battle wildfires ravaging seven Western states, the National Interagency Fire Center said Monday in a news release.This is the first time soldiers have fought wildfires since 2006, and the call out shows how bad the problem has become.About 95 fires have destroyed hundreds of homes, caused the evacuation of more than 1,000 people and burned 1.1 million acres in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, California, Nevada and Colorado, the NIFC said.The soldiers will handle "quiet parts of the fire," NIFC spokesman Ken Frederick said"That's important because it frees up our more experienced crews to handle more complex dangerous fire situations," he said. "So they (soldiers) could be mopping up, watching for and waiting to put out spot fires and digging fire line."The soldiers will come from the 17th Field Artillery Brigade, 7th Infantry Division, at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington, which has one of the worst wildfire problems.Active duty soldiers have been used to fight wildfires 35 times since 1987, the NIFC said."The U.S. military has been a key partner in wildland firefighting for decades, and we greatly appreciate their willingness to provide us with soldiers to serve as firefighters," said Aitor Bidaburu, chairman of the National Multi-Agency Coordinating Group.The military is also providing C-130s equipped to drop large quantities of fire retardant.The NIFC fire alert level has hit the highest level -- last reached August 20, 2013, the NIFC said.
