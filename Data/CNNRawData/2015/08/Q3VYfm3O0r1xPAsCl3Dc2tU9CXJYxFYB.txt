Story highlights A NASA camera shows the moon transiting Earth, with the far side illuminatedThe "dark side of the moon" is much more rugged than the near side seen by Earth(CNN) You can't call it "the dark side of the moon" based on a new NASA picture.A camera on the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite shot an arresting view of the moon crossing in front of the Earth.
