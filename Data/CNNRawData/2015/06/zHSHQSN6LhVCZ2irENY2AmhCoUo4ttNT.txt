(CNN) Five fires at predominately African-American churches in several states are in the spotlight.News that federal investigators are investigating the fires -- for signs of arson or hate crimes -- has been making waves on social media, where the question is posed with a hashtag: #WhoIsBurningBlackChurches.The mass murder of nine people at the Emanuel AME in Charleston, South Carolina -- a house of worship specifically targeted because it is a black church -- was a stark reminder that no building is safe from racist, hateful attacks.Dylann Roof, the self-confessed racist gunman, posted a manifesto on white supremacy that stated that Emanuel AME was targeted because it is a "historic African-American church."With the news of five fires in the South at predominately black churches, comes that question: Who is behind these fires?Only a fool would truly believe that Dylann was one of a kind #WhoIsBurningBlackChurches — Wicked Little Things (@monteyjames91) June 29, 2015Investigators at the FBI and ATF, as well as local officials, say the answer isn't simple.In at least one of the church fires, arson has been ruled out.Investigators have concluded that the fires were set intentionally at two churches, but that hate crimes are not suspected.The causes of the remaining two churches are still under investigation."We are looking at all of them along with ATF," a federal law enforcement official told CNN. "No reason at this point to link them, but we are continuing to investigate."Black Churches Are Burning Again in America http://t.co/Bac5RMcTv2 pic.twitter.com/ljbA3x6kJQ — SPLC (@splcenter) June 29, 2015Following the massacre in Charleston, and the renewed controversy over the Confederate battle flag, it's conceivable that white supremacists might carry out attacks, said Mark Potok, senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups."There's no apparent connection, nothing to say they are connected," Potok told CNN. "It's speculation at this point."The most recent hate crime attacks on religious institutions have been on Jewish synagogues and Islamic mosques, not black Christian churches, he said.Still, there is a history of racist attacks on black churches that cannot be ignored or forgotten.The September 15, 1963, bombing of the 16th Street Church in Birmingham by the Ku Klux Klan is something most U.S. students learn about in history class. But that was just one of hundreds of attacks."There were scores and scores and scores of arson and other attacks on black churches during the civil rights era," Potok said.One of the recent fires struck the College Hill Seventh Day Adventist church in Knoxville, Tennessee."When I look at this I see, I think of an intention to try to destroy this entire church," the Rev. Cleveland Hobdy III, told CNN affiliate WATE . "It makes it sad. It's sad either way that someone would put their mind to try to damage a church that's trying to help people."After Charleston, there seems to be a renewed awareness of the how odious hate crimes are, and of the history of attacks on black churches.
