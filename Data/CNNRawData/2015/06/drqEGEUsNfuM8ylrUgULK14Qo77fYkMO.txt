(CNN) Searchers scouring flood debris from torrential Memorial Day weekend rains in Texas have found a man's body, bringing the state's death toll from the storm to at least 23.The searchers found the as-yet unidentified man Saturday in debris near the Blanco River in San Marcos, Texas, city officials said in a statement. Authorities don't know whether the body is that of a 42-year-old man who remains listed as missing in the flooding, along with two children.The discovery comes amid a major expansion in the federal disaster declaration for Texas counties affected by the storm. On Friday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency added 20 counties to three named in the original May 29 declaration making federal assistance available to individuals.Torrential rains in May caused widespread flooding in Texas, inundating businesses, knocking out bridges and sweeping some homes from their foundations. More than 37 trillion gallons of water fell on the state in May, according to the National Weather Service.It would be enough to cover every bit of the state with ankle-deep water, according to meteorologists.Storms also caused destruction and deaths in Oklahoma and Mexico, according to authorities.On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson was in the Houston area to see some of the areas hardest it."What's interesting about this particular disaster, this particular flooding, is there's no one widespread area of damage," he told reporters.And while residents and business owners clean up, Texas farmers are just beginning to brace for the worst.Crop losses in the state will likely reach "many millions of dollars," Gene Hall, director of public relations for the Texas Farm Bureau, said last week.Among those affected: hay farmers who can't get into their mushy fields to harvest and cotton farmers who can't plant.Some farmers -- likely a small but significant number -- will lose their entire crops, Hall predicted."It's shaping up to be a pretty rough year," he said. "To some degree virtually all farmers in the state have been affected."
