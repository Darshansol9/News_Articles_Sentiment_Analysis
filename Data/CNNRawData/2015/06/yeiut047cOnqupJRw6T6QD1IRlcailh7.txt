Story highlights The test ends as the chute deploys, but it does not inflate"We'll study data from this test to learn & improve," NASA tweets(CNN) NASA's "flying saucer" took to the skies without trouble Monday, but one of the main technologies it was testing -- a parachute meant to help future craft land on Mars -- didn't work as planned.A giant supersonic parachute meant to slow the saucer-shaped Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator 's descent to the Pacific Ocean -- one of two braking technologies that the craft was testing Monday -- deployed but failed to inflate.The craft safely splashed down into the ocean off the Hawaiian Island of Kauai, but the failure of the Supersonic Ringsail parachute to inflate will be a disappointment for NASA.Reaching Mach 4, #LDSD's SIAD deployed & inflated. Chute deployed, but did not inflate.
