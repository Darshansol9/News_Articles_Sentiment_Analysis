Cedar Rapids, Iowa (CNN) As the national debate boils over whether to allow Syrian refugees into America, I've come to an unlikely place -- Cedar Rapids, Iowa-- to learn more about Syrians who are already here.Syrians and Lebanese came to this city in the heartland in the late 1800s, settled and brought their families over. They became a vibrant part of the social fabric. They were doctors, lawyers, businessmen, engineers and teachers. Muslims and Christians. Their children were born here and raised as Iowans.I am walking the streets to learn the opinions of people who are used to seeing an imam say prayers at the police department and finding hummus and falafel on restaurant tables. Cedar Rapids is home to the oldest mosque in America as well as a Syrian Orthodox church.It's also a place where residents have felt the sting of anti-Arab sentiment in recent years after global terror incited by groups like al Qaeda and now, ISIS.Many here are upset that Americans -- including their governor -- want to shut the doors to newcomers from Syria. Maria Canas, 40, arrived here in 1999 from the suburbs of Damascus.
