Story highlights When wedding called off by the groom-to-be, bride-to-be family held banquet for the homeless"It was really a blessing," one guest said"I feel ... heartbreak for her, but I will take away something good from this," said mother(CNN) After her fiance called off the wedding, a devastated bride-to-be in California turned lemons into lemonade -- and a full banquet -- for Sacramento's homeless.Kari Duane told CNN affiliate KCRA she couldn't believe it when her 27-year-old daughter Quinn called her to tell her that the groom-to-be had called off the wedding."When we found out ... that the wedding would not be taking place, it just seemed like, of course, this would be something that we would do to give back," Kari Duane said of Saturday's banquet.Deposits had already been made for the $35,000 wedding so instead of canceling and letting the food go to waste, the bride's family invited the city's homeless to dine at Sacramento's Citizen Hotel on Saturday.JUST WATCHED Guest gets bill after not showing up to wedding Replay More Videos ...
