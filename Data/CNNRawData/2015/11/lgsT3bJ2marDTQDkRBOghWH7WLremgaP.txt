Story highlights Veterans Day is Wednesday, November 11"Veterans don't always ask for help. There's a lot of pride," says head of aid groupThere are ways to honor Veterans every day(CNN) "What day is Veterans Day?"It was a simple question my colleague asked me a few years ago. I was startled, then a little horrified. I wondered how anyone could not know when America officially honors military Veterans. When I was growing up, and even now, every day is Veterans Day.My dad was a veteran of Korea and three combat tours in Vietnam. He never talked about his military service but it was the phantom of my childhood. He had an explosive temper and terrible nightmares. He drank too much and yelled even more. He never held a job for more than a year or two, if at all, and looking back now, I realize he must have suffered terribly.But he loved America, his kids and happy hours at the VFW. He hated hippies, foreign cars and people who belittled the armed forces. Red, white and blue were his favorite colors. He carried his service around in his heart, his mind and in the metal shrapnel scattered in his body until the day he died. For him, every day was Veterans Day, because he lived his time at war in some way, every day.It's a family tradition. My Grandfather fought in the trenches of Europe in World War I, my uncles served in World War II. My brother Ole joined the Marines when he was 17 and retired more than 35 years later. Although he doesn't talk about his time in Iraq and Afghanistan, he, like my dad, carries his service in his heart and his mind. My brother always says his heroes are the Marines he lost in Iraq. To this day, he honors those men by staying in touch with their families and keeping their memories alive. Every day will always be Veterans Day for him.Read More
