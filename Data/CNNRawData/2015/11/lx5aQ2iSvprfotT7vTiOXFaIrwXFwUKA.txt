Story highlights A star system caught extraterrestrial intelligence experts' attention in October after an unusual light pattern was observedAfter monitoring a space anomaly for two weeks, SETI says it has not detected radio signalsNASA says the star was likely surrounded by comets(CNN) An anomaly in deep space that has been the focus of speculation and observation for weeks over possible extraterrestrial life may have just been solved.A research team from Iowa State University looked at data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, and found that the strange dips in light, which were initially theorized to be possible structures, were likely a "swarm of comets."The system, KIC 8462852, had been under scrutiny since its unusual light fluctuation was discovered by users of the online astronomy crowdsourcing site Planet Hunters. The group uses publicly available data gathered by NASA's Kepler Telescope, which has been tasked with finding Earth-like planets by searching for the periodic dimming of stars that might suggest such a planet is passing by.But NASA says the Kepler Telescope only viewed the star in "visible light," and in this case, they searched by infrared light."It's possible that a family of comets is traveling on a very long, eccentric orbit around the star," NASA said in a statement. "At the head of the pack would be a very large comet, which would have blocked the star's light."Read More
