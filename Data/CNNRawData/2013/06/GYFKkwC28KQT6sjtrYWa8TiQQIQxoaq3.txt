Investigators scouring a 24-square-foot area where the fire is thought to have begun on June 11 have "all but ruled out natural causes," Maketa said."I can't really go any further on that, but I can say we are pretty confident it was not, for instance, a lightning strike," Maketa said.The sheriff said earlier this week the fire was being treated as a crime scene, meaning in part that investigators were preserving every piece of evidence that they could. But he said he wasn't ready to say whether a crime was committed.The fire rapidly ravaged woods and neighborhoods in a mostly rural area northeast of Colorado Springs last week, and firefighters struggled to keep up in the early days, thanks to little rain and blustery windsBut more favorable conditions helped firefighters raise containment from 5% Friday to 65% Sunday.
