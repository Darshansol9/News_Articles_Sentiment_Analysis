She passed up a payout spread over 30 years for a somewhat smaller one-time lump sum, pocketing $370.9 million before taxes, Lottery Secretary Cynthia O'Connell said.Mackenzie bought her winning ticket at a supermarket in Zephyrhills, north of Tampa. She did not appear at Wednesday's announcement, but in a statement O'Connell read to reporters, she said it was the fifth ticket she'd purchased for that drawing."While in line at Publix, another lottery player was kind enough to let me go ahead of them in line to purchase the winning quick-pick ticket," Mackenzie said.JUST WATCHED Powerball winner allowed to skip in line Replay More Videos ...

That total was surpassed only by a $656 million Mega Millions drawing in March 2012, split among winners in Illinois, Kansas and Maryland.Mackenzie was accompanied by her son, a "trusted family friend and her legal and financial advisers" when she came in to the lottery's Tallahassee headquarters to get her winning ticket validated, O'Connell said. She said Mackenzie waited "to make sure they were ready to handle the types of responsibility that come with that kind of a jackpot win."
