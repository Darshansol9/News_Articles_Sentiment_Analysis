A Washington state bridge that collapsed last month over the Skagit River will reopen Wednesday, Gov. Jay Inslee said Tuesday.The bridge's failure on May 24 sent cars tumbling into the river and severed the state's main artery to Canada, on which trucks carry an estimated $13.9 billion annually in U.S.-Canada trade cargo.Roughly 70,000 vehicles a day travel on Interstate 5 over the bridge, the state Department of Transportation said.
