First reported as extending five acres, the fire eventually grew to 50 acres, said Hillsborough County Fire Rescue spokesman Ronnie Rivera.Southbound traffic was being diverted off the highway at Sun City Center "due to zero visibility." For a time, vehicles likely were also prohibited from moving northbound. The closure extended for 11 miles -- between mile markers 229 and 240 -- the Florida Department of Transportation reported on TwitterBy 3:15 p.m., the fire was contained -- although, by then, a mobile home was destroyed and several vehicles had burned, according to Rivera. Conditions had improved enough to allow for I-75 traffic to resume moving northbound; southbound traffic was still stopped because of poor visibility.The National Weather Service had issued a hazardous weather outlook for the area, warning that "dry fuels and low relative humidity will result in favorable conditions for the spread of wild fires."Saturday's forecast for Ruskin was for mostly sunny skies with high temperatures around 76 degrees and sustained south-southwest winds of around 10 mph.Conditions should be even warmer and windier Sunday, the weather service predicts, with a high near 80 degrees and winds gusting as strong as 21 mph.
