March 18, 2013As CNN Student News begins a new week, we consider the state of Syria's civil war two years after the violence began. We also examine U.S. missile defense strategy, and we explore a controversial decision to remove headgear from amateur boxing. Plus, we break down some numbers on St. Patrick's Day, and we see how some college students turned dancing into dollars for a children's hospital.Teachers: We're looking for your feedback about CNN Student News.
