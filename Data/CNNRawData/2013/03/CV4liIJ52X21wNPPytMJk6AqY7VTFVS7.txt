The Detroit City Council voted 7-1 Wednesday to challenge Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder's decision for the state to take control of the financially troubled city.Snyder said Saturday that Detroit lacked an adequate plan to resolve its $14 billion debt and he would invoke a state law to appoint a manager to assume control of the city's operations."I don't view it as a takeover," Snyder told CNN on Saturday. "It's really about bringing about more tools and resources to help grow Detroit."Managers previously have been appointed for the cities of Flint and Pontiac, he said.
