It's not easy," Fitzsimmons said.The Wheeling YWCA also is maintaining a message board where people can leave notes of support for the victim. Thousands have left encouraging words, and they are being sent to the teen."People seem to need to send a message," Jones said. "It's important to them that she get the feeling for how much the community and the world wants to support her."The Wheeling YWCA serves an estimated 30,000 people a year across three counties. It also is part of a larger national movement that focuses on empowering women to change their lives for the better.If you are a rape victim or know of someone who needs help, the national rape hotline is 1-800-656-HOPE (4673) and the national domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233.)
