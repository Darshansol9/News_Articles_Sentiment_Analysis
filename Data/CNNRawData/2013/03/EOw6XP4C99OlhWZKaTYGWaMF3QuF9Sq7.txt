March 1, 2013Our last show of the week is our first of the month, and it starts off by looking at who would (and who wouldn't) be affected by the likely spending cuts of the U.S. government. We also kick off our Women's History Month coverage with a report on how the annual event got started. And we uncover what materials could make the next generation of robots stronger and cheaper.Teachers: We're looking for your feedback about CNN Student News.
