The high school friend, who was not in on the ruse, called Bulgaria himself and had two tweets from Kate's Twitter account including one that said, "Someone help me."It was enough to launch a search of hotels and hostels in one Bulgarian town by authorities there. But there was no kidnapped Kate to be found in Bulgaria -- because there was no Kate.Through online investigations, authorities traced Kate back to Mykhaylivskyy, who admitted the "joke" in an interview with State Department investigators earlier this month, according to authorities..Mykhaylivskyyy was in federal court in Newark Tuesday, where his bail was set at $5,000 with the condition that he only use the Internet for educational purposes and that he continue school.Mykhaylivskyy's lawyer, K.
