The document shows he was read his Miranda rights in the hospital on April 22.Tsarnaev is charged with killing four people -- three spectators who died in the April 15 bombings and a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer ambushed in his cruiser a few days later.At least 264 people were wounded in the double bombings, which took place near the marathon finish line.He is awaiting trial, after having pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges. If convicted, he could receive up to life in prison or the death penalty.His older brother, Tamerlan , is also accused of the attacks. He was killed when Tsarnaev ran over him as police were trying to handcuff him, authorities said.CNN learned in the weeks following the bombing that Tsarnaev admitted to the acts, and said he and his brother acted alone. Sources say he has since stopped talking with the government.
