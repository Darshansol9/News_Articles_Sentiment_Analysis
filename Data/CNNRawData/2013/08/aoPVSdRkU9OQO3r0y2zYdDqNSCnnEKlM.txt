Another who followed the vehicle reported that children were inside.At around 10:30 p.m., when police tried to pull the vehicle over, it veered to the right and hit a pole, Martos said."This was one of those situations when the officers believed they were trying to rescue kids from a possible kidnapper," Martos said."When they ran up to the vehicle, they found an 8-year-old in the driver's seat, and a 6-year-old in the passenger seat, severely injured."Responding officers started life-saving measures until the fire department arrived, Martos said.Both the children were dressed in their pajamas. The 6-year-old was not wearing a seat belt. The air bag did not deploy.The mother, who lives within a block of the where the accident occurred walked to the scene and discovered that her children were in the car.The 6-year-old died around 4 a.m. Thursday in a local hospital. The 8-year-old boy was treated for minor injuries.Martos said at this point they do not know what prompted the 8-year-old to take his mom's car. They have not spoken to the boy, but no criminal complaints are expected to be filed, he said.
