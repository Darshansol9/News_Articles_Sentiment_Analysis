MUST WATCH CNN Explains: Performance enhancing drugs 02:28CNN has not been able to reach Anthony Bosch, who ran the clinic, or other key figures involved in the clinic since the Miami New Times reported in January that more than a dozen professional baseball players and other athletes were named in records kept over several years by the facility.One of the players wrapped up in the scandal is Alex Rodriguez, a 38-year-old New York Yankee who ranks fifth in home runs in major league history.Recent reports have suggested that Rodriguez, who has been rehabilitating all year from an injury, could be suspended for a sizable amount of time as a result.Yet in an interview this month with CNN , he declined to talk about what has or might still happen, saying, "It's premature, and we'll let the process play out."The Biogenesis scandal appears already to have ensnared one star: Ryan Braun. Earlier this month, the 2011 National League MVP, five-time All-Star and Milwaukee Brewers outfielder was suspended without pay for the rest of this season for violating the league's drug policy, Commissioner Bud Selig announced.
