His next post was of fruit on the plane.Souza told Time.com that he would only be shooting on his iPhone."Since my primary function will always be photographing with my regular cameras, the Instagram photos will be more from situations away from the primary action," he said.Souza's favorite filter is no filter, though he's used Lo-Fi a few times, he said.Of the first 24 photos posted, three include the Obamas' dog, Bo."I love Bo especially because we're both of Portuguese descent. That said, photographing a dog with black hair is certainly a challenge," he said.It's doubtful that we'll see a selfie from Souza, he said.
