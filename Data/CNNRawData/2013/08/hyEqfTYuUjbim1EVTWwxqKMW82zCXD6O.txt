"When I saw the teeth that's I knew it was real, it was no toy."The shark, described as weighing between five to 10 pounds, was discovered near a row of seats by passengers on the Queens-bound N train at the 14th Street stop.The shark had blood on its mouth, as though it has recently been punctured by a fishing hook, according to Cano.The shark quickly drew a crowd, as entering subway riders began to photograph and pose with the shark, even adding a subway fare card, soft drink can and a cigarette to the supine shark as props.JUST WATCHED Did Discovery Channel jump the shark?

Sea Dog Brew Pub manager Jim Agnew told CNN.Asked whether anything out of the ordinary happened that evening, Agnew could only point to having to ask two people to leave, but those were "peaceful ejections" he said -- adding that the customs had since returned to the bar.Some have speculated that the appearance of sharks in mysterious places is a publicity stunt for the Discovery Channel's "Shark Week." Photos of the two mysterious sharks have exploded on social media using the hashtag #sharkweek.Discovery Channel denies any involvement."Shark Week is all about conservation, so it deeply saddens us that someone would think that this was funny or in any way connected to our celebration of sharks," said spokeswoman Laurie Goldberg.MTA officials told CNN they have no plans to "continue investigating" how the shark got on the subway.
