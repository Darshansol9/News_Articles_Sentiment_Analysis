"I kind of felt weird."CNN has made multiple efforts to contact Filner and his representatives on the latest allegations but has not gotten a response.JUST WATCHED San Diego's mayor headed to rehab Replay More Videos ...

It's a good thing that behavior that would have been tolerated in the past is being called out in this generation for what it is: inappropriate and wrong," he said in a statement issued July 11.But Filner has also said he believes he will be vindicated by "a full presentation of the facts" and he will not resign.In late July, Filner said he planned to begin counseling Monday.In a statement given at City Hall, he apologized "to the women I have offended.""The behavior I have engaged in over many years is wrong. My failure to respect women and the intimidating conduct I engaged in at times is inexcusable," he said.Battling a lawsuitFilner's former spokeswoman, Irene McCormack Jackson, and nine other women have accused Filner of sexual harassment. Up to this point, Jackson is the only accuser to file a sexual harassment suit against Filner.He asked the city to pay for his legal fees; the city council voted against thatJackson said Filner subjected her and other women to "crude and disgusting" comments and inappropriate touching.
