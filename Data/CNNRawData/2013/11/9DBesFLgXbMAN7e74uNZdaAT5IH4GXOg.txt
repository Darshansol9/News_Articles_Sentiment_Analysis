Authorities identified the man as Gerardo Nales, a 42-year-old man from Key Biscayne, Florida.After searching until dark Thursday, authorities resumed their efforts early Friday, expanding the search area based on currents and weather conditions, police said.Police think it's unlikely Nales could have survived the fall. They're describing the search as a recovery mission.A police spokeswoman said it was unclear whether Nales accidentally fell out of the plane or deliberately jumped.Investigators questioned the 47-year-old pilot but did not release his name. Homicide detectives also are involved, as they are in all death investigations, Miami-Dade police spokeswoman Sgt. Robin Pinkard said.The pilot first told air traffic controllers that a door was open on the plane, then added that a passenger had fallen out."I have a door ajar," he said, "and a passenger that fell down."The Piper PA-46 -- a private plane -- went on to land safely at Kendall-Tamiami Executive Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Baez declined to say whether the owner of the plane was on the flight.
