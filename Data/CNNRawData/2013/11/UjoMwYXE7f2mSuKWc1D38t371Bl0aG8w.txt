"Especially in light of the fact that I have two more children that are gay.""We want to express care and concern for everyone involved in this difficult process," Michele Bartlow, district superintendent of the United Methodist Church, said in a statement following the guilty verdict. "We ask for prayer."The penalty phase of the trial begins on Tuesday and new witnesses will be heard, Husid-Shamir told CNN.The jury has full power to determine Schaefer's penalty, which can range from a reprimand or suspension to a full defrocking, Husid-Shamir said.
