Baez declined to say whether the owner of the plane was on the flight.Investigators were questioning the pilot at the airport. Homicide detectives, who are involved in all death investigations, also responded, Miami-Dade Police spokeswoman Sgt. Robin Pinkard said.The pilot first told air traffic controllers that a door was open on the plane, then added that a passenger had fallen out."I have a door ajar," he said, "and a passenger that fell down."
