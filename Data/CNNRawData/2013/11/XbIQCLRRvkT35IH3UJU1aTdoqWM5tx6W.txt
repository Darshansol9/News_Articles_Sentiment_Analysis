Officials evacuated planes, re-screened passengers and searched bags and cargo, but did not find explosives.Cau, of Dallas, pleaded guilty in August to one count of false information and hoaxes, but in a plea agreement admitted to making eight bomb threats.Cau's lawyer, Craig Charles, said Cau was given credit for the six months he has already served, leaving him with about a year left on the sentence. He faces possible deportation to Germany when he gets out, Charles said."My client was very clear that he was remorseful for the things that were done. He wishes to put this behind him and move on with his life," Charles said.
