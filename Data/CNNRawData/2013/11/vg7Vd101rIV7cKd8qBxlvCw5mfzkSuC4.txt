"It's been a tough road."A motorcyclist reported finding possible skeletal remains Monday in an area not far from Interstate 15 near Victorville, according to the Sheriff's Department.Police found two shallow grave sites, with two sets of remains in each grave, McMahon said.February 4, 2010 was the last day anyone saw the family or heard from them. When police entered their Southern California house more than 10 days later, they found eggs on the kitchen counter and bowls of popcorn in the living room. Their two dogs were also in the home. But not a single trace of the McStays.The McStays lived in Fallbrook, about 18 miles from the Pacific Coast and some 50 miles north of San Diego.The family's locked and abandoned Isuzu Trooper was located February 8, 2010, in San Ysidro, California, just two blocks from the border. Surveillance video taken that night shows a family fitting the description of the McStays walking into Mexico. But from there the trail goes cold.The sheriff said his office said it will look at this crime from the beginning, and will work with the FBI to find the suspects.Although investigators said someone had been researching travel to Mexico on the family's home computer, the McStays' sudden disappearance and the fact that their credit cards and bank accounts went unused raised suspicions.When they disappeared three years ago, Joseph was 40, his wife, Summer, was 43, and their children were 4 and 3 years old."I've been in this business for over 35 years, but I've never seen anything like this," Lt. Dennis Brugos of the San Diego Sheriff's Department told CNN shortly after the disappearance.
