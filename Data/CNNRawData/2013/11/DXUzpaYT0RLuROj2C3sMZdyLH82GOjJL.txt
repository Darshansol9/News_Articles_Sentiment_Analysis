There was no sinkhole, he said.The Red Cross responded to the home, where five adults and two children lived, after the floor bubbled up."They had to leave with basically only clothes on their back," said Janet McGuire, a Red Cross spokeswoman.Tampa Fire Lt. Richard O'Connor said crews were going into the home Tuesday morning to determine how deep the hole is.Family members told police they had a house assessment done nine months ago and were told the house was on top of a possible sinkhole, O'Connor said.The family is staying at a hotel with Red Cross-issued vouchers.
