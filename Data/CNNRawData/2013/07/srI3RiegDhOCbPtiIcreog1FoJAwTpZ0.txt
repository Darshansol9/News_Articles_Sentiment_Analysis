(CNN) -- Dale Irby retired this year after a four-decade career teaching gym and driving a school bus near Dallas, Texas. But his departure ends another long tradition: Irby wore the same outfit for every school yearbook photo for 40 years.After he accidentally wore the same shirt and V-neck sweater in his first two yearbook photos, his wife, also an educator, jokingly dared him to continue. By the time he retired, it was a (slightly ill-fitting) tradition."I don't think I'll be wearing it again," the Garland, Texas, man told CNN's New Day . "It's pretty snug."Follow us on Twitter @CNNschools!
