Story highlights Chrysler recalls 490,000 Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep vehiclesIt has to do with a fault controller related to its active head restraintThe company knows of no injuries or accidents tied to the problemEarlier this month, Chrysler reluctantly recalled 2.7 million vehiclesChrysler took the preemptive step this week of recalling nearly half a million vehicles because of issues with the active head-restraint function found in several makes and models.The problem is related to a "potentially faulty microcontroller (that) entered the supply chain after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan caused a worldwide microcontroller shortage," Chrysler Group said in a news release issued Wednesday.Because of such defective microcontrollers in some vehicles, the active head restraints -- which are supposed to automatically move forward during some rear-impact crashes, thereby helping prevent neck injuries -- aren't working properly.The Chrysler Group said it doesn't know of any injuries or accidents tied to the issue.Some 442,000 vehicles sold in the United States are affected by the recall, as well as 25,000 in Canada, 10,000 in Mexico and 12,000 elsewhere.Makes and models affected by the recall are:JUST WATCHED Chrysler agrees to recall Jeeps Replay More Videos ...

Even then, the company still claimed the 2.7 million recalled vehicles -- 1993 to 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokees and 2002 to 2007 Jeep Libertys -- are safe.
