Story highlights Protesters vow to stay at Florida governor's office 24-7 until he meets with them22 states have laws saying residents have no "duty" to retreat from attackersNational Rifle Association defends laws, saying self-defense is a "human right"Gun policy expert: Laws a "very bad idea," research shows they increase homicideThey walked into the office Wednesday, led by Amon Gabriel, 9, and asked to speak to Florida Gov. Rick Scott.He wasn't in the office, the receptionist replied, apologizing."Thank you. We'll wait," said one of the protesters.The Dream Defenders, like many groups and individuals appalled by Stand Your Ground laws around the nation, aren't seeking a casual sit-down with their elected official; rather, they want to take him to task for defending the self-defense provision.About 30 of them came early Wednesday, and more were expected later in the day."I'm upset but I'm not using it in, like, a physical punching way," Amon explained. "I'm using it in a talking and calmly way."JUST WATCHED Florida Stand Your Ground Replay More Videos ...

The Dream Defenders said they'd stand vigil inside the Capitol, outside the governor's office, 24-7 until Scott agreed to meet."We'd like the repeal of stand your ground or some type of modification where we can hold people responsible to a level that humanity expects, where we don't have 17-year-olds getting gunned down with no justice for them and their families," the group's legal and policy director, Ahmad Abuznaid, said.JUST WATCHED Juror B37 wants return to normal life Replay More Videos ...

Stevie Wonder is refusing to perform in any state with such a law.U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the laws "try to fix something that was never broken" and now encourage "violent situations to escalate in public."But just as adamantly as the laws are decried, the National Rifle Association has stood by the measure it helped many states adopt."The attorney general fails to understand that self-defense is not a concept, it's a fundamental human right," said Chris W. Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action. "To send a message that legitimate self-defense is to blame is unconscionable."As for those Dream Defenders hoping to speak with the Florida governor, their protest may be futile. Scott's office noted that a gubernatorial task force recommends the law stay in place , though with minor tweaks, including limiting neighborhood watch to observing and reporting.Daniel Webster, director of Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said he doubts the protests will change anything. Overturning laws isn't incredibly common already, and with Stand Your Ground, there are complicating factors.The NRA is strong in the 22 states that have the laws, and "I think there is some popular appeal to the notion, the very general notion that citizens should be able to protect themselves and you shouldn't have to, in essence, run from crime."Also, the laws are relatively new, most of them enacted in the past eight years, and it's unlikely the same legislators who put Stand Your Ground laws on the books would suddenly be inclined to think they were wrong."The more common response is they're going to dig their heels," he said.As a parallel, Webster offered the "Draconian" drug-sentencing laws of the 1980s, which hugely expanded incarceration rates, were outrageously expensive and did little in the way of improving public safety. Yet, the country is only now examining those laws and considering their repeal."I assume, in part, that's because the people who passed them are no longer there," Webster said.The trickiest factor, however, is that proponents and opponents of Stand Your Ground can find in the Zimmerman case facts to support their beliefs, he said.One side believes Trayvon attacked Zimmerman, and ZImmerman had no choice but to fire his weapon to defend himself. The other side believes Zimmerman racially profiled Trayvon, followed him against a dispatcher's order, then shot a teen who was only reacting, perhaps out of fear, to being followed."You can find whatever you want to back your assumptions," Webster said.JUST WATCHED Stevie Wonder boycotting Florida Replay More Videos ...

"Unfortunately, attendees at the NDAA symposium expressed little confidence that criminals would take the provisions of the Castle Doctrine into consideration before committing a crime."Webster pointed to a Texas A&M University study examining crime in more than 20 states that passed Castle Doctrine or Stand Your Ground laws from 2000 to 2010. Researchers found that not only was there no decrease in robbery, burglary and aggravated assault, but there was an 8% spike in reported murders and non-negligent manslaughter"The data are pretty compelling, showing that it increased justifiable homicides and it increased homicides overall," Webster said. "In all likelihood, it really led to more altercations similar to the Zimmerman-Martin exchange."
