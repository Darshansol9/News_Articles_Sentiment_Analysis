The parents of five teens who attended the party reported the presence of strippers to police.The complaining parents found out that the strippers had been at the November 3 bowling party through photos posted on Facebook. The parents took the pictures to the South Glens Falls police, who then started taking witness statements, the district attorney's statement says.One of the photos distributed by the district attorney's office shows Viger receiving a lap dance from one of the hired dancers; another picture shows a young male with another nearly nude dancer on top of him with her legs around his head."As difficult as it may be for us to have to weigh in on these kinds of cases, certainly exposing the unsuspecting children to this sort of 'entertainment' goes beyond the pale when it comes to what is appropriate for 14, 15 and 16 year old child," Murphy said in the statement.CNN affiliate WRGB visited the Viger home and encountered a man who said the family "was not making statements at this time."CNN's calls to Viger, her attorney and the adult entertainment company that provided the dancers were not immediately returned.
