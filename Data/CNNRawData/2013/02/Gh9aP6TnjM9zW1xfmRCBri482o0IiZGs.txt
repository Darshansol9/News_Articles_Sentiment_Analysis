It was then that police say he stabbed a Florida detective multiple times and disappeared. That detective, and another, had been transporting Morales from Florida to Nevada. The trip began on a Miami-Houston-Las Vegas flight.Prior to landing in Houston, Morales began "acting erratically," according to a statement from the Miami-Dade Police Department. As a result, he and the detectives were not allowed to board their connecting flight, it said.The detectives rented a vehicle and continued on their way, making a pit stop in Grapevine to use the restroom. While one of the detectives was inside, Morales stabbed Det. Jaime Pardinas, a 28-year veteran, multiple times, and fled the scene, authorities said.Pardinas was treated at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas and was listed in serious condition, the statement said.Morales was arrested in Nevada in 2008. He was brought to Miami, where he was jailed pending a 2003 case alleging burglary, kidnapping and sexual battery. In December, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 10 years in prison, which was to run consecutive to a Nevada sentence.Details of Morales' Nevada case were not immediately known.When asked by a reporter how authorities felt at the conclusion of the manhunt, Eberling said he was relieved for local residents."We knew we had a dangerous individual out there in the streets. And he was capable of being extremely violent. So that is what we're relieved of. The fact that Mr. Morales is now deceased is not something that we celebrate, but our jobs is to apprehend the fugitive," he said. "It is a relief to this community and I think a lot of folks in this area can now have a moment of rest."
