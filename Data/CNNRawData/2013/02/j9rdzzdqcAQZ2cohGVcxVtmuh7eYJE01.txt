We will look around every corner. We will search every mountaintop," Riverside Asst. Police Chief Chris Vicino told reporters Saturday.In the snow-packed San Bernardino Mountains, officers trudged through fresh snow as they searched homes, knocking on doors and peeking in windows, for Dorner.But as the search continued with no sign of Dorner, questions were raised about whether he escaped the dragnet -- possibly days earlier.Arrest warrantA federal arrest warrant affidavit said Dorner's burned-out truck was found on the property of a known associate in the Big Bear Lake area Thursday afternoon.There has been no sign of Dorner since Thursday, and there has been speculation, based in part on the affidavit, that he has possibly crossed state lines into Nevada or made his way into Mexico.Authorities say Dorner spent at least two days in the San Diego area following the shooting of Quan and her fiance.Dorner's ID and some of his personal belongings were found Thursday at the San Ysidro Point of Entry at the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the affidavit.Border patrol agents have been searching cars crossing into Mexico for signs of Dorner, while authorities have searched a home Dorner owned in Las Vegas and one owned by his mother in La Palma, California.Two sailors also reported Dorner, a former Navy lieutenant, approached them at the San Diego-area Point Loma Naval Base, and local police allege he attempted to steal a boat.Even so, the focus of the manhunt remains on the San Bernardino Mountains where the search has been slowed by heavy snowfall.Search teams were aided by helicopters, snowcats and armored personnel carriers with snow chains.On alertLos Angeles-area police and a number of military installations have been on alert since the shootings, while authorities chase down a number of unconfirmed sightings of the 270-pound, 6-foot Dorner.In the manifesto and on a Facebook page, Dorner allegedly singled out as targets a number of officers and their families, who have been under guard since the shootings.The LAPD chief on Saturday described the police shooting of two women who were driving a pickup similar to the one Dorner owned as a "tragic, horrific incident."In an interview with CNN affiliate KCBS, Beck said the shootings of Margie Carranza, 47, and her mother, 71-year-old Emma Hernandez, occurred a day after the manhunt for Dorner began.He said the officers were under enormous pressure.
