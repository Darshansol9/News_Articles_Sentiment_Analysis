Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri and a host of other farm-heavy states have seen crop losses as a result.The Kansas Department of Agriculture expects those conditions to continue into April, but near-record levels of snowfall will ease the problem and could help the drought end faster."It snows so infrequently here.
