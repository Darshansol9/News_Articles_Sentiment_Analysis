Authorities eventually released Curtis but not before learning that Curtis knew Dutschke.The two men knew each other because Dutschke used to work for Curtis' brother at an insurance company.If inhaled, injected or ingested, less than a pinpoint of ricin can kill a person within 36 to 48 hours due to the failure of the respiratory and circulatory systems. There is no known antidote.
