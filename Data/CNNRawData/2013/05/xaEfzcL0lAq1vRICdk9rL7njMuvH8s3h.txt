His condition was stabilized very quickly, said the source.The FBI was inside the trauma room during the stabilization and several other law enforcement agencies were outside the room, including the FBI, Boston police and Beth Israel police, according to the source.JUST WATCHED Defending the Boston bombing suspect Replay More Videos ...

FBI agents stayed nearby during surgery, the source said.Within a matter of hours he was moved to an ICU unit on the upper floors of the hospital. There were no other patients in that secure unit for the duration of the time that he was there and Tsarnaev recovered very quickly, the source said."He was in much better shape than most people thought," the source said, but had serious wounds to his throat and leg.He has since been transferred with the help of U.S. Marshals to Federal Medical Center, Devens -- a federal prison specializing in long-term medical care, about 40 miles west of Boston.At Devens, he is locked inside a 10-by-10-foot cell with a steel door, a slot for food and an observation window, a prison spokesman said Sunday.Tsarnaev is now able to speak and has been interacting with medical staff, spokesman John Colautti said.
