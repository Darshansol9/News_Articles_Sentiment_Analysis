Ten people riding in a five-passenger car when it crashed early Monday were injured, including eight children, police in Newark, New Jersey, said.The accident happened around 1:30 a.m., according to a news release from the Newark Police Department. Police say the Dodge Neon crashed into a fence, though video shot by CNN affiliate WABC shows that it hit a tree.Three of the children -- a 17-year-old boy, a 3-year-old girl and an 18-month-old girl -- and their mother remain in critical condition, while the other five children have been released from the hospital.Witness Janette McCoy told WABC that the mother managed to escape from the car and ran to her for help."She goes, 'please help me, please help me.' She was bloody, her hands and stuff. The baby was bloody," McCoy said at the scene. "You don't know how these people actually got out of the car alive."It remains unclear who was driving the car and whether the man in the car is related to the children. The Essex County prosecutor's office is taking over the investigation, police said. No charges have been filed.
