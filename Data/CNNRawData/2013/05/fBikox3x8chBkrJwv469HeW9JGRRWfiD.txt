(CNN) -- Chelesa Fearce is the valedictorian at Charles Drew High School near Atlanta, Georgia, but it didn't come without a fight. The 17-year-old and her family have been homeless for years, living out of shelters, cars and occasionally short-lived apartments while her mom struggled to keep a job.But Chelesa would crack open books at the homeless shelter and read against a cell phone light, she told CNN affiliate WSB . She's graduating with a 4.46 GPA, and is heading to Spelman College in the fall with enough credits to be a junior.Her advice to students? "Do what you have to do right now so that you can have the future you want," she said.
