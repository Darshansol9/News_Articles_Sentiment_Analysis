Story highlights Poker player rewards Las Vegas cabbie who returned $300K left in backseatCabbie and his bosses still aren't giving gambler's name"He doesn't want me to mention his name," cabbie Gerardo Gamboa saysHis native Philippines is going to give driver a resolution of commendation, tooA Las Vegas cabbie who returned $300,000 left in his car has received a $10,000 reward from the poker player who lost the cash.But cab driver Gerardo Gamboa and his bosses on Friday still weren't revealing the name of the 28-year-old professional gambler, whom they earlier described as a famous figure on the poker circuit."It's good enough, I really appreciate it," Gamboa said about the reward. "I wasn't expecting anything from the people I help. I never expect anything from the people I do good for, but I really appreciate it and that he appreciated what I'd done for him."Before the gambler forgot his paper bag of cash in the cab's backseat, the poker player tipped the cabbie $5 on a $9.90 fare, Gamboa said.The brown paper bag, with wads of $100 bills inside, was discovered when Gamboa picked up his next fare."I really appreciate that because when somebody gives me $5 it means they appreciate my service," Gamboa said.When pressed for the high roller's name, however, Gamboa was, well, poker-faced himself."You know, he doesn't want me to mention his name, and I want to keep his privacy. He doesn't want any publicity," Gamboa said.The gambler and cabbie didn't say much during the two-mile ride Monday between hotel casinos in Vegas."We didn't have any conversation," Gamboa said. "The only thing I told him was I take him where he was going. He didn't say hi or bye but he was an outstanding person, his attitude and everything, and how grateful he is since I found his money."Meanwhile, Gamboa's native country of the Philippines is going to honor him.The office of President Benigno Aquino III called the cab company and said it will send a resolution of commendation to him, said Bill Shranko, chief operations officer at Yellow Checker Star."They are so proud of me, and I am so proud of what I have done," Gamboa said.His countrymen, family and employer hold that pride, he said, "because I did the right thing and didn't think twice because I was not interested in those money that did not belong to me."He has been surprised by the international attention."I have a lot of people calling me and telling me how honest I am. That's the way I am, that's the way my parents raised me when I was a kid," he said.Yellow Checker Star gave Gamboa a $1,000 reward, made him driver of the year, and gave him a steak dinner for two.His boss also gave him four paid days off.Those who make their living in the cab business are enjoying the moment: Cabbies are no longer maligned -- whether it's for running up the fare or refusing to stop when hailed on the street -- and are generating international good will, Gamboa's boss said."This is the best thing to happen to drivers worldwide because they don't have a good reputation and they work incredibly hard, 12 hours a day, and they do a tremendous job for tourism worldwide," Shranko said.On New Year's Eve -- one of the busiest days in the cabbie business -- Gamboa will be back at work on the Las Vegas Strip. That's where the cabbie picked up the forgetful gambler and proved his honesty in a town better known as sin city.
