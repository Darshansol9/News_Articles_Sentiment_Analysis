He was 24 years, and on the road to establishing himself as a music icon, the statement said."A tremendous amount of international interest was generated at the time of the sale's announcement, and today's result justifies the mythic status of this guitar in the annals of music history," said Tom Lecky, Christie's specialist and the sale's auctioneer.Along with the guitar and original Fender case, newly discovered song lyrics by Dylan were also auctioned, according to Christie's. The items were left behind on a private plane months after the 1965 performance.
