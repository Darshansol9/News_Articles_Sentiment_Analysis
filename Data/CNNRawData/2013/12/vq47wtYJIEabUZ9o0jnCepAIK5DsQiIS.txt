"I was surprised and upset to see on YouTube that SeaWorld used 'I Love Rock 'n' Roll' as the opening music for its cruel and abusive 'Shamu Rocks' show," Jett wrote in a letter to SeaWorld President Jim Atchison on December 11. "I'm among the millions who saw 'Blackfish' and am sickened that my music was blasted without my permission at sound-sensitive marine mammals. ... These intelligent and feeling creatures communicate by sonar and are driven crazy in the tiny tanks in which they are confined." A SeaWorld spokesman said that although the park had licensed the song legally, it will no longer be used in the shows.

MUST WATCH The story of a killer whale 03:03A Malibu, California, school recently canceled its annual overnight field trip to the park after students spoke out in opposition, and a San Diego, California, high school cinema class posted a video to YouTube with students pledging to spend no more money at SeaWorld until the company changes its practices.Social media sites critical of SeaWorld also are filled with comments from people vowing they'll never go to the parks again after viewing the film.SeaWorld has consistently rejected the "Blackfish" accusations, including in statements to CNN, but the ads published Friday are perhaps its most visible effort to defend itself.• Denied accusations that it captures killer whales in the wild, saying it last did so 35 years ago.• Said it does not separate whale calves from their mothers except for "the rare occasion that a mother killer whale cannot care for the calf herself."• Rejected claims that its whales suffer shortened lifespans.• Argued its work with universities, governments and nonprofits has helped advance scientific understanding of killer whales in the wild, and said it has spent $70 million in recent years on habitats, which it calls "among the largest in the world today."The statement released by PETA challenged SeaWorld's claims.For instance, the animal rights group said, "Although SeaWorld is right in stating that five of its whales have life spans similar to those of orcas in the wild, it fails to note that nearly every other orca at SeaWorld -- some 35 of them -- has died prematurely from violent accidents, preventable injuries, illnesses caused by stressful living conditions, and more."In its ad, SeaWorld says, "Our guests may enter our gates having never given much thought to the remarkable animals in our oceans ... When they leave with a greater appreciation for the importance of the sea, educated about the animals that live there and inspired to make a difference, we have done our job."The problem, notes crisis communications expert David Johnson, is that some of those former guests are finding themselves increasingly uncomfortable about their affection for SeaWorld, and are willing to share their squeamishness with the world.While SeaWorld can get along without entertainers, widely watched images of children rejecting field trips to the parks will be more troublesome, Johnson said."Oh, it's really damaging," he said.Evidence of whether that proves to be the case could be revealed in February, when the company should next file quarterly reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission showing its financial performance for the quarter that included the CNN airings of "Blackfish."The company depends entirely on admissions and concession sales for its revenues, which totaled $538.4 million in the three months that ended on September 30.
