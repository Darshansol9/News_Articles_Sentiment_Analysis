The selling price nearly tripled Rockwell's previous auction record, "Breaking Home Ties" which sold for $15.4 million in 2006, according to Sotheby's.Seven of Rockwell's paintings sold Wednesday came from the family of Kenneth J. Stuart Sr. -- a longtime friend of the artist, and art editor at The Saturday Evening Post -- and nearly totaled $60 million, according to Sotheby's.The other top two Rockwell sales were "The Gossips," which had a pre-sale estimate of $6 million to $9 million and sold for a little under $8.5 million, and "Walking to Church," which had a pre-sale estimate of $3 million to $5 million and sold for a little over $3.2 million."Saying Grace" originally appeared on the Thanksgiving issue cover of The Saturday Evening Post in 1951. The painting hung in Stuart office and later on was transferred to the family dining room, according to Sotheby's catalog.
