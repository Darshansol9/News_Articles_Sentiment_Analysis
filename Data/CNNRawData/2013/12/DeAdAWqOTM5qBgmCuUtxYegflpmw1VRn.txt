They worked on a class experiment together in which they went into the community and tried breaking unwritten rules, Stutz said."I did think he was a little weird, but I didn't think he was, like, bad weird," Stutz added. "He always kind of talked about how America was a communist country, how the government was, like, trying to take us over and stuff. I don't know, just some weird stuff that I didn't really pay close attention to, but nothing that alarmed me."He was definitely kind to me. I never saw him mean to anybody. He wasn't condescending to anyone," he said.In Friday's shooting, Pierson was armed with a shotgun, a bandolier stocked with ammunition, a machete and three Molotov cocktails, Robinson said.

It may have been trigger point."Pierson was active in his community, KUSA reported.He took pride in how he routinely won contests on his speech and debate team, the station reported.
