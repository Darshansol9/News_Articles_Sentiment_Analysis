Story highlights A Marine is cited with communicating a threat in a videotaped road rage incidentHis unit is gathering information for potential legal or administrative proceedingsMarine in a wheelchair and her brother were in other carVideo shows young man using hands and feet to wail on vehicleA Marine is being investigated for potential legal or administrative proceedings after a video this week showed him in a profanity-loaded road rage against another motorist at Camp Pendleton, California, a Marines spokesman said Friday.The Marine, whose name, rank or unit weren't being released, was cited for communicating a threat in the incident, but he wasn't charged as of Friday, said Sgt. Christopher Duncan, a Camp Pendleton spokesman.The video, which went viral on the Internet, shows a young man yelling outside a truck, and he uses his hands and feet to wail on the truck whose driver sits calmly behind the wheel with the window rolled up. A woman passenger films the video.The video caption states there was an accident between the two vehicles in which the angry Marine's car was struck allegedly "because of slamming on his brakes numerous times." In the truck was a civilian driver and his passenger who is "a fellow Marine who is in a wheelchair," the caption says.CNN affiliate KGTV reported that the driver is the caregiver to and brother of the woman Marine, who is paralyzed from the waist down.The cited Marine was released to a representative of his unit, and "any further legal proceedings regarding this incident would be at the discretion of his unit, which is still gathering information," Duncan said in a statement."I have no information when potential legal or administrative proceedings would take place," Duncan said. "This individual's behavior does not meet the standards that are expected of our Marines, and it has received the attention of senior base staff."The incident took place Monday at about 2 p.m., Duncan said.
