Jim Macedo said late Monday night.So far, despite an extensive manhunt and beefed-up security at schools in Valley Springs, authorities don't have enough information to name a suspect or even create a composite sketch in the death of Leila Fowler."This is a sad time," said Calaveras County Sheriff Gary Kuntz. "We will not rest until we capture the responsible person."Leila, an 8-year-old known for her bubbly personality, was stabbed to death at her home over the weekend.JUST WATCHED No suspects in girl's stabbing death Replay More Videos ...
