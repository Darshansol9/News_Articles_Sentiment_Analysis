April 8, 2013CNN Student News starts the week with reports on violence in Afghanistan, jobs numbers in the U.S., and a 5,000 mile journey made by some fish. We also hear why a high school student is running for a seat on his local school board. And we meet a CNN Hero whose "Brilliant Bus" aims to bridge the digital divide for some students.
