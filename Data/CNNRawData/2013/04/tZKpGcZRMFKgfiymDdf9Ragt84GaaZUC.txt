The commission voted unanimously."We have the full support of the sheriff's department, right down to every man that we spoke to as a deputy, and their support for this is overwhelming. Now we ask for your support."'She lost everything'Crum was sworn in as sheriff on Thursday night at the county courthouse, just blocks from where her husband was shot.She did not speak, but she hugged 22 deputies who came to the ceremony, Hubbard said.Baisden said he met with Crum earlier in the day, and that she was understandably emotional. He explained another part of the rationale behind her appointment."She lost everything she had. She lost her husband, and would have lost a paycheck," he said."We told her we felt like this is the sure way that we could take care of her until she got on her feet."An election to replace Crum is set to be held in May 2014. Whoever wins will take office on January 1, 2015.Photographs of the new sheriff on her Facebook page show a woman with an easy smile. She holds a paintbrush in one picture -- a dog, a baby and her husband tight in others.Justin Marcum, an assistant prosecutor in Mingo County, said having Crum step into her husband's shoes should help in the healing process."Everyone here in the community knows her. It's small town U.S.A., and it will help us overcome the void that's in our hearts," he said."It's just a symbolic way that we can move forward and get past this tragedy."
