That's when they realized that the guy had actually shot at him, hit him, struck his cell phone, and the cell phone had stopped his bullet," Winter Garden Police Lt. Scott Allen said.The chest pains were caused by the impact of the bullet on the cell phone, which was in the clerk's chest pocket, according to WESH.He didn't suffer any other injuries and was quickly released after being checked at a hospital, the TV station said.His HTC smartphone came off worse. A photo showed its screen shattered around a hole where the bullet had lodged."I've seen individuals get shot with low-caliber handguns and I've seen it be life ending. So, for this gentleman to be as lucky as he is, it's a good day for us," Allen said.The other clerk was reported to be unharmed.Police described the suspect in the attack as a black man about 6 feet tall wearing a dark-colored hooded sweatshirt, pants, sunglasses, a bright yellow traffic vest and white gloves, according to WESH. He remained on the loose Monday evening, it reported.Authorities aren't disclosing the name of the clerk who was shot, the TV station reported.
