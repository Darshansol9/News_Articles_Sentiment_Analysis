Story highlights Backpacks, hydration packs won't be allowedSpectators at NYC Marathon will be subject to inspectionProcedures follow bomb blasts at Boston finish lineThe ING New York City Marathon is tightening security at next month's race in the wake of the terror attack bombings at this year's Boston Marathon.The November 3 race will have more inspection points and race coordinators are banning items such backpacks and hydration packs, Farrell Sklerov, spokesman for the New York Road Runners told CNN.Spectators at the end of the race who wish to watch from grandstands and those in the family reunion area will be subject to baggage inspections and screenings, according to the marathon's website.Delegates marching in the opening parade will not be allowed to carry bags, according to the website."The safety of runners and spectators has always been our highest priority," New York Road Runners said in a press release. The organization coordinates the race.Runar Gundersen--- who will be running his 35th New York Marathon this year -- told CNN that he is very aware of the increased security."It will obviously cause some problems for us, but that doesn't matter," Gundersen said. "Security must come first, so I gladly accept delays... I think most runners do."This year, the NYRR partnered with a security firm to conduct a "top-to-bottom analysis" of the existing security plan, according to race officials."As a result, we are strengthening our already comprehensive security plan in ways that the public will and won't see in order to ensure the event is as safe as possible for runners, spectators, and volunteers," the group said."I know that it's impossible to protect 26.2 miles of road 100%," Gundersen said. "The feeling about that is much like it was in 2001 after 9/11."NYRR is also adding a "Staten Island Day" to this year's race activities. It will be held on October 13 and will include a half marathon and other community events, which will raise money for Superstorm Sandy recovery.Last year's New York City Marathon was canceled by Mayor Michael Bloomberg due to damage from Sandy.Two brothers -- one now dead and the other facing charges -- are suspected of planting two bombs near the Boston Marathon finish line that left three people dead and more than 260 wounded in April. According to authorities, at least one of the bombs was hidden inside a backpack.
