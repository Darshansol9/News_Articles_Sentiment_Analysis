The story was first reported by DNAInfo.com, a site specializing in crime news.Bonanno says the officer belongs to a motorcycle club and was riding with hundreds of bikers who participated in the September 29th rally, but insists he didn't witness the assault on Lien."He wasn't aware of anything of the nature posted on YouTube and he doesn't have any firsthand knowledge of what was going on," Bonanno said."Once all the videos are reviewed and witnesses interviewed, we'll find that my client has no culpability for anything that happened that day."Bonanno offered no explanation as to why the officer waited so long to tell his superiors he was there. "That will be addressed in an appropriate time and manner," he said.JUST WATCHED Witness: There was blood all over him Replay More Videos ...
