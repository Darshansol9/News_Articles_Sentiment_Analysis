Several bikers dismounted and approached the vehicle, with one of them opening its door, before Lien then drove away again.Motorcyclists continued their pursuit, with some speeding ahead of him to help halt traffic. That's where the ordeal ended, with Lien getting dragged out, kicked and hit.He suffered cuts to each eye, his right cheek, the left side of his body, and his lip, in addition to a pair of black eyes and abrasions to his hand, back and shoulder, according to Turino.His wife and 2-year-old daughter were unharmed.
