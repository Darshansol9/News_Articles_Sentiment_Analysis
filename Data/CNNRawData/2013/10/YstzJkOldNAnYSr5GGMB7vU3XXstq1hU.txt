The perpetrator also removed bolts from the base of the 100-foot tower, contributing to its downfall, she said.In the substation fire, the suspected arsonist left behind a message: "You should have expected U.S." was inscribed on a control panel, the bureau reported.The FBI said removing bolts from the tower "would have created substantial noise" during the early-morning incident, the FBI said in a written statement.On October 5, power was knocked out to thousands of people after someone cut into, then used a tractor to pull down, two electrical poles in Cabot. The power lines were owned by First Electric Cooperative.
