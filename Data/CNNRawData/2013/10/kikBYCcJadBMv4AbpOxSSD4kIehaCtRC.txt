We really went down," Matthew Fass, musical director of the parade, said in an online video, adding that without donations from the public, the parade would have been canceled again.Online organizers say that the parade will provide a much-needed economic boost to the area's local businesses, which was hard-hit by the storm.Often referred to as the Village Halloween Parade, the annual festivities have taken place on Halloween every year since 1973 and include more than 60,000 participants. Two million spectators line a mile-long stretch of 6th Avenue to watch, the online campaign boasted.
