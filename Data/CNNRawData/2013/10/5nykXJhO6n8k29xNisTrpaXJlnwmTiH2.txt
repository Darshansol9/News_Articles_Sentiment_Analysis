"I'm glad I'm not an elephant. I'm five months with my first. I am impatient with my nine months. I couldn't imagine 22 months. I think i know what i will be planning for my daughter's first bday....maybe a zoo trip."This is the the second pregnancy for Asha. Her first calf, Malee, was born two years ago, the zoo reported.The father is a 43-year-old named Rex, who is from the African Lion Safari in Cambridge, Ontario. He has sired five offspring previously, according to the Oklahoma City Zoo."Asha has proved to be a great mother -- she's diplomatic, setting boundaries when she should while giving Malee the appropriate freedom to explore," said Nick Newby, the zoo's pachyderm supervisor.
