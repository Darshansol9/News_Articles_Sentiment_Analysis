He retired from the Navy in 1969, after some two decades of service.Post-NASA, Carpenter explored underwater environments as an aquanaut in the Navy's Man in the Sea Project -- at one point living and working on the ocean floor for 30 days straight. He later served as director of the Navy's aquanaut operations."I still can't make up my mind whether I like outer or inner space better," Carpenter said last year -- adding with a smile, "But there's a difference in glory."Carpenter's memoir, "For Spacious Skies: The Uncommon Journey of a Mercury Astronaut," was published in 2003. He also wrote two novels."He was one of the good guys and a good friend, a pioneer who made significant contributions to our country," said Dick Gordon, command module pilot for Apollo 12.
