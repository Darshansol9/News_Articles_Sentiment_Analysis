Story highlights Canadian buyer pays more than $12k for seat near home plate at Fenway ParkBoston Red Sox hope to banish the Curse of the Bambino by winning series at homeAverage price for a Game 6 ticket on one online broker is $2,189 on TuesdayA front-row seat to potentially witness history Wednesday night at Fenway Park in Boston won't come cheap -- and neither will the tickets for standing-room-only.The last time the Boston Red Sox won a World Series at home, the team featured a 23-year-old ace pitcher named Babe Ruth, who won two games en route to a 4-2 series victory over the Chicago Cubs.That was 1918, the year in New England lore when the Sox supposedly fell under a curse that kept them from ever again winning the World Series.Though the Curse of the Bambino was finally vanquished with Boston's World Series title in 2004 -- and then for good measure in 2007 -- those victories came on the road, not at their Fenway Park home.So now, with only one more win to go, some fans are shelling out big bucks just for the chance to witness what they hope will be one final Fenway exorcism.The average price for a Game 6 ticket on online broker TiqIQ.com was $2,189 on Tuesday evening, while the cheapest available on StubHub.com was a standing-room-only ticket on the right field roof box for $983.75. One Craigslist posting offering "CHEAP" Game 6 tickets (in all caps, apparently to hammer home the bargain) led to a broker selling standing-room-only for $774.But the person who shelled out the most for America's pastime on StubHub didn't even come from America: A fan from Calgary paid a whopping $12,092 for a seat near home plate, according to StubHub spokeswoman Shannon Barbara.That's pretty staggering, considering the Red Sox paid Ruth less -- around $7,000 -- for the entire 1918 season, according to Baseball Almanac.The Red Sox lead the St. Louis Cardinals 3-2 in in the best-of-seven series. If a seventh game is necessary, it would also be played at Fenway Park, so either way, a team donning red will be celebrating in Boston this week.
