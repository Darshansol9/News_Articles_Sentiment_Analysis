Story highlights Winter weather advisories are in effect for parts of the Carolinas and VirginiaIcy conditions cause more than 200 wrecks around Charlotte, CNN affiliate reportsSome 100 flights are canceled out of that city's international airportAiman Youssef can't catch a break with the weather.First, Superstorm Sandy leveled his home and devastated most of his neighborhood in the New York City borough of Staten Island. Now, an arctic blast that forecasters warn can have deadly consequences is gripping the region.Late Thursday, a gas-powered heater and a tent were the only defense Youssef had against the biting cold as he handed out jackets and sweaters at a makeshift supply depot he established to help his Midland Beach neighbors who, in some cases, are still struggling to get the power back on."A lot of people have been coming, so we give them jackets, we give them sweaters," he told CNN affiliate NY1 . "Yeah, we are trying. We are trying our best to help them."But even as he helped his neighbors, he wondered how long he could keep the heater running at the tent where some of his neighbors were seeking shelter. Gas, he said, is expensive.JUST WATCHED Sandy victims suffer through cold snap Replay More Videos ...

Pat McCrory canceled his Friday evening schedule on account of the icy conditions."We do want to encourage people to be very, very careful on what are anticipated to be very slick roads throughout North Carolina," WRAL reported he said. "We don't want to see anyone take any risks."Caught in the snowThe snow in Pennsylvania played a role in the apprehension of suspected armed robbers, authorities said.Investigators in Moon Township, just outside of Pittsburgh, tracked the footprints of three people and arrested them in connection with the robbery of a taxi driver at gunpoint Wednesday, police told CNN affiliate KDKA.The footprints in the fresh snow, according to police, led from the scene of the robbery to the front door of one of the suspects.
