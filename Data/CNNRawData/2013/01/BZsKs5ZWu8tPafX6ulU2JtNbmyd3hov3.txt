"(Thursday) is a regular schedule, and we will do the kinds of things that we know are good for kids."Counselors were also on hand to help parents, students, teachers and administrators in coping with the emotional toll of returning to class.Swansiger said that while there were "some emotional moments in the beginning of the day ... you couldn't walk around the corner without someone asking if you were OK."
