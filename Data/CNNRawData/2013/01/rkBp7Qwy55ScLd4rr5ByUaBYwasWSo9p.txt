MUST WATCH Berman to Corbett: Football came first 04:34Paterno, who coached at Penn State for 46 years, was fired after authorities arrested Sandusky, a Penn State defensive coordinator who retired in 1999 and founded a charity for young people.In 2002, a graduate assistant brought to Paterno allegations of Sandusky's sexual abuse in one of Penn State's facilities. Paterno informed his supervisors of the report, but the school's board of trustees fired Paterno in November 2011, saying he could no longer perform his duties in the shadow of scandal.In an interview with the Washington Post published a week before he died, Paterno said that he felt inadequate to deal with the allegations."I didn't know exactly how to handle it and I was afraid to do something that might jeopardize what the university procedure was," the Post quoted him as saying. "So I backed away and turned it over to some other people, people I thought would have a little more expertise than I did. It didn't work out that way."Sandusky was convicted in June 2012 on 45 counts of child sex abuse. He was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison.The mural has been altered in light of the scandal. The artist painted over an image of Sandusky and also removed a halo above Paterno's head.
