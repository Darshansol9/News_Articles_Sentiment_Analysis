Story highlights Investigator want to know how cyanide entered Urooj Khan's systemHe died a day after receiving winnings from $1 million scratch-off ticket in IllinoisCause of death has been ruled a homicideNo arrests madeThe body of a million-dollar lottery winner will be exhumed for additional testing after toxicology results revealed the Illinois man died of cyanide poisoning, a judge ruled Friday.Urooj Khan won the prize in June on a scratch-off ticket. The next month, he was dead.Investigators initially ruled Khan's cause of death natural. But after being prompted by a relative, the Cook County medical examiner's office revisited the case and found a lethal amount of cyanide in Khan's system."That ... led us to issue an amended death certificate that (established) cyanide toxicity as the cause of death, and the manner of death as homicide," Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Steve Cina said Monday.Authorities are hoping to use the exhumation to determine how the cyanide entered Khan's system. The exhumation is expected to occur Thursday, CNN affiliate WGN reported.JUST WATCHED Lotto winner's death now murder mystery Replay More Videos ...

Talking briefly with CNN affiliate WBBM and the Tribune, Khan's widow described her husband as kind and exemplary.Jimmy Goreel, who runs the 7-Eleven where the winning lottery ticket was sold, offered similarly glowing comments about Khan."I would never think that anybody ... would hurt him," Goreel told WGN.
