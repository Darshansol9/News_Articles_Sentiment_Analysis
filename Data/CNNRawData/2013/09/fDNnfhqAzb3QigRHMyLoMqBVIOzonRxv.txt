What is wrong with you!?!"While it appears the postcard was a hoax, authorities are not finished with their investigation."If the intent behind the message was to cause alarm and cause the police to search that location, then it is a crime -- like screaming fire in a crowded theater," Mirabelli said. "But it depends on the offender -- are we dealing with a child or an adult? A whole lot of factors to consider."The postcard implying that a killing may have been committed remained at the top of the website Monday . Warren did not return a CNN request Monday for comment.
