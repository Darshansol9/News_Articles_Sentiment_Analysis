In plain language, cops say she knifed the victim -- her former boyfriend -- because he wouldn't stop playing the band known for hits including "Hotel California," "Heartache Tonight" and "Desperado."The 64-year-old victim suffered lacerations on an arm, elbow and hand, police said in a report, but was not seriously injured.The man was listening to The Eagles when his housemate told him she didn't want to hear the band anymore, according to police. Their disagreement quickly escalated when the victim told the woman to "shut up," police said.The woman then went to the kitchen, grabbed a 14-inch serrated bread knife and started to swing it at the man, police said. The man was cut several times before he and a friend restrained the woman.The two men eventually let her go, only to have the woman grab another knife and cut the victim several more times, police said.Police added that "all parties involved were intoxicated."As to whether a particular Eagles song took the argument to the limit, a police spokesman said he didn't know.
