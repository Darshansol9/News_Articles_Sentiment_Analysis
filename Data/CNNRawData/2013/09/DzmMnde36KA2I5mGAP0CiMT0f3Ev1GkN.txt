Their father managed to escape from the basement."I wasn't thinking right; I don't know what I was thinking. It was so unlike me. I'd never done anything like that," Hayes told the Register during an hour-long interview from prison.He said it took him a year to even remember what happened in those final moments."I was told it was rage and stress or something. I just know that for a couple of minutes, I became somebody else," he said. "I'll never forgive myself for that."William Petit, who remarried last year, did not respond to Hayes' comments.But his sister-in-law, Cindy Hawke-Renn, said they were "too little, too late."How do you plan such behavior and allow people to die at your hands and burn alive, especially when you have children of your own? Snapped? Doesn't sound like an excuse to me," she told the Register.Hayes said he was sorry for what he did and expressed feelings of "guilt, shame and remorse" about the deadly 2007 home invasion.He reportedly tried to commit suicide before his trial started and told the Register that he wishes he had been successful."I don't deserve to live," Hayes told the newspaper. "I don't want to live."However, he added, he no longer thinks about killing himself."I realize now I've got to live with this pain. It's something I'm supposed to live with," said Hayes.
