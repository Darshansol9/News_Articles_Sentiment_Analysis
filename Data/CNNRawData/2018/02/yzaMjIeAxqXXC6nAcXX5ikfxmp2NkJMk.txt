(CNN) President Donald Trump was "ghoulish and inappropriate" in politicizing a fatal drunken driving crash involving an undocumented immigrant, the Indiana prosecutor overseeing the case said.Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry filed four felony charges Wednesday against Manuel Orrego-Savala, a Guatemalan citizen who had been deported from the US twice, for allegedly drunkenly operating a vehicle and killing NFL linebacker Edwin Jackson and Jeffrey Monroe in Indiana early Sunday morning.In announcing those charges, Curry criticized Trump and others for focusing on Orrego-Savala's immigration status rather than the tragedy of two lost lives."We will vigorously prosecute this matter, just like any comparable crime, not because of the immigration status of an accused, but because two innocent men lost their lives in this horrible incident," Curry, a Democrat , said in a statement."We are disheartened that ghoulish and inappropriate public commentary has politicized this tragedy. Much of such commentary, including tweets by the President, fails to acknowledge that both Edwin Jackson and Jeffrey Monroe lost their lives on Sunday," he added. "We will simply seek justice on behalf of the families of those two victims."The sharply worded comments came a day after Trump said it was "disgraceful that a person illegally in our country" killed Jackson, a linebacker for the Indianapolis Colts. Trump called on Democrats to "get tough on the Border, and with illegal immigration, FAST!"So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson. This is just one of many such preventable tragedies. We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border, and with illegal immigration, FAST! â€” Donald J.

Minkler, a US attorney for the Southern District of Indiana.Edwin Jackson, 26, started eight games in 2016 for the Colts, but did not play this past season due to an injury."Edwin was loved by all in the Colts organization," the team said.

He was arrested and taken to jail for further processing.Scott Rolston of Whitestown Police said the department generally would not communicate with ICE for a typical traffic stop.Cabrera Gonsales pleaded guilty to operating a vehicle while never receiving a license, which is a misdemeanor, according to documents provided by CNN affiliate WISH-TV . He was sentenced to two days in the Boone County Jail and released after one day served.Deported twiceOrrego-Savala was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in October 2006, and deported to Guatemala in January 2007, according to a federal criminal complaint.He was prohibited from returning to the United States for 10 years, according to federal officials.Two years after he was deported, he returned to the United States illegally, and was deported again two months later in May 2009, with an order not to come back for 20 years, according to the complaint.County authorities gave the suspect's name as Orrego-Savala, but the US attorney's office identified him as Orrego-Zavala.
