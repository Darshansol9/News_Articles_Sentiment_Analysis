(CNN) A California couple who started a Facebook campaign to reunite immigrant families will not stop raising money -- despite President Donald Trump's recent reversal on separating families that cross the US border.Dave and Charlotte Willner have raised over $17 million from more than 460,000 donors since they started the campaign Saturday. The money goes to the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, or RAICES."This is a reminder of the power we have when we all stand together against injustice and now RAICES ' work becomes more important than ever.

This fund will allow them to work with other local organizations to make sure the donations reach as many people as possible.Read More
