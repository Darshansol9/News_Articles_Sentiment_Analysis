Binghui Huang, a former staff writer at the Capital Gazette, recalled on Friday how her former colleagues touched her life when she worked there."I didn't sleep much last night, she told CNN. "I don't think my friends did either and we have been sharing memories of each one of them and sometimes they're memories make us laugh, I guess those are the good moments that we have."Huang remembered how nervous she was about telling victim Rob Hiaasen, an editor for the paper, that she was moving on from the newspaper. "The paper meant a lot to me, it gave me a chance," she said."When I told him, I started to cry a little bit. I felt so bad about leaving," she said. "And he looked at me and he said you know what, I don't think I want to see you here in another year or two because he knew that I was ready to leave, and he wanted me to achieve in my career whatever I can."She recalled Gerald Fischman's sharp eye for editing their "sometimes convoluted" stories."Gerald is kind of quiet, but he's so smart, he has such a sharp eye and at night his job was to clean up everyone's copy," she said. "We were a small paper, a lot of us were young. Stories were sometimes convoluted. He would try to make sense of it and crack jokes about how it made no sense. And coming from Gerald, this quiet, sweet dude was hilarious."
