Families are not pawns. It's that simple. This is not about politics. This about who we are as a country. We must stand together and stand up when we see injustice anywhere. #FamiliesBelongTogetherhttps://t.co/Vdt84JE9pG â€” MoveOn (@MoveOn) June 28, 2018"Since the beginning, President Trump has shown callous disregard toward mothers, fathers, and children who only want to find safety," Amnesty International USA's tactical campaigns manager Ashley Houghton said in a press release"Last week's executive order presents a false choice to people seeking protection. Detaining families is not the solution to ending family separation. Every family approaching the border must be treated with dignity and respect," Houghton said. "The administration must end the cruel and unnecessary practices of family separation and detention."Where are the marches taking place?The main march is taking place in Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C., across the street from White House.
