(CNN) The White House says Melania Trump wasn't sending an immigration message with her "I Really Don't Care" jacket. But demonstrators who riffed on it Saturday sure were.Protesters at immigration rallies across the country held or wore slogans suggesting the opposite message: "I really do care."A woman holds a "Yes Melania I do care" sign at an immigration rally Saturday morning in Miami.In New York, protesters Annie Scott and Fernanda Kock wore olive green T-shirts with the message "I Really Do Care" on the front."We're here because we think this is important," Scott told CNN about attending the rally to protest the White House's " zero tolerance " immigration policy.The "I Care" messages recall first lady Melania Trump's recent wardrobe choice. Boarding a plane last week to see an immigrant children's shelter in Texas, she wore an olive Zara jacket with "I Really Don't Care. Do U?" in graffiti-style lettering on the back.Trump didn't wear the jacket at the facility, and her spokeswoman insisted the first lady wasn't conveying a hidden message. But critics complained her clothing choice was insensitive, given her destination and the ongoing national debate over immigrant family separations.Thus, the "I Really Do Care" symbols on display Saturday.The Ickowitz family takes part in Saturday's Washington rally.
