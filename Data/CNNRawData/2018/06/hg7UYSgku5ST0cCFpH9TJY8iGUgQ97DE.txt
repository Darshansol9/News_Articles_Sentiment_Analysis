(CNN) For the seventh time in eight days, an explosion at the Kilauea summit on Hawaii's Big Island erupted Thursday morning with a force equivalent to an earthquake of magnitude 5.3 or higher, according to the US Geological Survey.The latest came at about 4:49 a.m. (10:49 a.m. ET), registering at magnitude 5.3 and sending "an ash-poor plume" 1,000 feet into the sky, the USGS said. It was the biggest of more than 400 earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 or higher that have struck in the vicinity of the volcano between noon Wednesday and noon Thursday, the overwhelming majority of which were minor temblors.KÄ«lauea Message Thu, 28 Jun 2018 05:27:52 HST: At 4:49 AM HST June 28, a collapse explosion event occurred at KÄ«lauea's summit. An ash-poor plume rose about 1000 ft above the ground and drifted SW. The energy released by the event was equivalent to a M5.3 earthquake. â€” USGS VolcanoesðŸŒ‹ (@USGSVolcanoes) June 28, 2018The other events:â€¢ On Tuesday, at 10:41 p.m., a collapse explosion at the Kilauea summit registered at magnitude 5.4.â€¢ On Monday at 5:03 p.m., a collapse explosion registered at magnitude 5.3.â€¢ On Sunday at 4:12 p.m., another one registered at magnitude 5.3.â€¢ On Saturday at 4:34 p.m., yet another event registered at 5.3.â€¢ On Friday at 6:52 p.m., a collapse explosion was equivalent to a magnitude 5.3 earthquake.â€¢ On June 21 at 1:14 p.m., a gas and ash emission at the summit also had force equivalent to magnitude 5.3.The USGS explains the consistency in the magnitudes as follows: "The energy being released ... is a reflection of the physical process that produces these events. That process seems to be remarkably consistent over time. It is likely controlled by the geometry of the caldera itself and the size of the piston collapse."Read More
