(CNN) Louisiana State University has put a fraternity on an "interim suspension" for what it says are violations of its student code of conduct.LSU spokesman Ernie Ballard did not share the nature of the allegations against the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity chapter, but a statement released by the university said the fraternity is under investigation for "very serious" allegations."We cannot go into specific details at this time, but the university will fully investigate the claims," the school's statement said. "If they are substantiated, then appropriate action will be taken."The alleged violation took place during this fall, according to a letter sent last week to the chapter's president from LSU Associate Dean of Students Jonathan Sanders.The fraternity chapter did not respond to CNN's effort to contact it. In a statement, Victor Tran, Pi Kappa Phi's national interim assistant executive director of communications, said the fraternity would cooperate with LSU and expected its members to do so as well.
