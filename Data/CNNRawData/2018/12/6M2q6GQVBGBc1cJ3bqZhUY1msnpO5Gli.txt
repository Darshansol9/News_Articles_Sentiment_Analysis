(CNN) A woman has filed a $100 million lawsuit against Hilton Worldwide, claiming a hotel employee secretly recorded her while she was naked in the shower and tried to blackmail her after posting the video to more than a dozen pornographic websites.The Chicago woman, identified in court documents only as "Jane Doe," had just graduated from law school in 2015 and was staying at a Hampton Inn and Suites in Albany, New York, to take the New York bar exam when she was recorded by a hidden camera in her room's bathroom, a lawsuit says."When you enter a hotel room, you have an expectation of privacy and safety. In my case, both of these things were stolen from me. What happened to me is an incredible violation and should be treated as a sex crime," the woman said in a statement through her attorney.She wasn't aware that she had been recorded until September when the footage was uploaded to a pornographic website with her full name and she began receiving emails from someone demanding more images of her, according to the lawsuit."Promise me my own show. That's the hottest. No need to show your face. Then I disappear and remove the video forever before they get copied on every website," one email stated, according to the suit.Read More
