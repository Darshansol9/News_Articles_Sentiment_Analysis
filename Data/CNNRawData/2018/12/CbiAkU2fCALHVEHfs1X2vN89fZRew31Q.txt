(CNN) The Broward County Sheriff's Office has placed a second officer who responded to the Parkland, Florida school shooting on "restrictive duty," spokesperson Gina Carter told CNN.The sheriff's office did not give a reason for the restrictions placed on deputy Edward Eason, which will last while an internal review is conducted.Eason must surrender his badge and weapon and may not drive a sheriff's vehicle or enter a department building, according to a memo released Friday. The memo didn't say what his duties would be.The sheriff's office told CNN that the discipline against Eason was due to testimony presented to the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission this month.The hearings revealed communication breakdowns among law enforcement and school staff as the shooting unfolded. Seventeen students and teachers were killed.
