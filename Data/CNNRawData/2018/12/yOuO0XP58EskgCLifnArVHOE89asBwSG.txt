(CNN) The nation's largest provider of migrant children shelters, in response to a New York Times report that the Justice department is investigating it for possible misuse of millions of dollars in federal money, told CNN on Friday it has not been contacted by federal investigators.Jeff Eller, a spokesman for the profit and nonprofit operations of Southwest Key, said neither Southwest Key programs or enterprises have been contacted, nor received a target letter.The United States Attorney's office for the Western District of Texas had no comment on the report, spokeswoman Lora Makowski said. She would not confirm nor deny that an investigation is taking place.The Times article cited two sources familiar with the matter who said the United States Attorney's office for the Western District of Texas and the FBI are trying to determine whether Southwest Key misused federal funds.The Times reported Southwest Key had acted more like a bank than a charity by "potential self-dealing with its top executives," stockpiling tens of millions of dollars and making real estate loans, including one that developers used to turn a former Walmart into a shelter that Southwest Key rents.
