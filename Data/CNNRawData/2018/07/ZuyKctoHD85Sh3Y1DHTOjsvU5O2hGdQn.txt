(CNN) A 26-year-old man was convicted of a hate crime on Monday for burning down a mosque in Victoria, Texas, in January 2017.A federal jury also found Marq Vincent Perez guilty of the use of a fire to commit a felony and possession of an unregistered destructive device in an earlier incident, in addition to the hate crime, according to the Department of Justice.A witness who had been with Perez on the night of the fire said Perez was excited to see the Victoria Islamic Center in flames, and that he was "jumping up and down like a little kid." Testimony included details about hate-filled messages on Perez's Facebook account, and his use of slurs when referring to Muslims, according to the DOJ.Perez's lawyer, Mark Di Carlo, said his client intends to appeal the verdict."The statements made by the United States Attorneys Office before the trial and after indicate that the case was handled as a political trial and not as a criminal trial," he said in a statement. "These include statements that the trial was about 'diversity' and 'equal protection for Muslims' which were inappropriate."Read More
