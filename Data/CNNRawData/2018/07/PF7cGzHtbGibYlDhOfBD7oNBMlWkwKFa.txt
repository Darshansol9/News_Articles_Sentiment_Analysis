(CNN) New York authorities announced the indictments of 12 men in the killing of an unarmed teen who was attacked in a case of mistaken identity in the Bronx.All 12 were arrested in connection with the fatal stabbing of 15-year-old Lesandro Guzman-Feliz, who was mistaken for a rival gang member and whose assault was caught on surveillance video on June 20, officials said Wednesday.They face charges including second-degree murder, first-degree manslaughter, second-degree conspiracy, first-degree gang assault and other charges. Five of those members were indicted on first-degree murder, officials said.Investigators said the 12 men, who were part of the "Los Sures" set of the Trinitarios gang, gathered at the Boston Road home of Diego Suero, the alleged leader of the group. They were plotting to commit violence against another rival group, also under the Trinitarios gang, known as "Sunset," officials said."This was an intragang conflict where the defendants allegedly plotted to attack an upstart set of the Trinitarios and allegedly committed a crime that has shocked people everywhere for its brutality," said Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark at a news conference on Wednesday.The body of Lesandro Guzman-Feliz is taken from the Our Lady of Mount Carmel church after funeral services last month.Read More
