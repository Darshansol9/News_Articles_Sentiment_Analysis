(CNN) The city of Austin was named after Stephen F. Austin, who is referred to as the "Father of Texas." But a report released last week by the city's Equity Office raised the issue that Austin had been a staunch supporter of slavery.The issue noted by the city's Equity Office has raised the possibility of renaming the city. The report released last week recommended renaming several streets and removing markers related to the Confederacy.The report also noted that Stephen Austin "fought to defend slavery in spite of Mexico's effort to ban it."He "believed slave labor indispensable for Texas to flourish" and "believed that if slaves were emancipated they would turn into 'vagabonds, a nuisance and a menace.'" It also said that Austin sought to have slave owners compensated if their slaves were freed.Austin's name was included in a list of the city's assets considered "not explicitly Confederate and/or Civil War related but were within the spirit of the resolution representing segregation, racism, and/or slavery." The Equity Office had put together the list to be considered for further input from City Council. This doesn't necessarily mean that the city will rename itself, but it has raised the possibility of looking further into this issue.
