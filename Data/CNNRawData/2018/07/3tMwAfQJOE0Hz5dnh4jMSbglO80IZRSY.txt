(CNN) A whirlwind of lava has been captured on video near Hawaii's Kilauea volcano.The spectacle is caused when "hot gases rise and punch through the cooler air above, to create a vertical column of hot air," according to the US Geological Survey. It started and stopped over the course of about 10 minutes.The whirlwind occurred at Fissure 8 on June 30. Video of the event was released Monday. The fissure's eruption sent lava about 180 feet into the air, the USGS said.Kilauea is Hawaii's most active of the state's five volcanoes, and in recent weeks, several craters have collapsed, causing more than 4,000 earthquakes -- most of them with a force equivalent to an earthquake of magnitude registering between 2 and 3, according to data from the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.The latest explosion happened Monday, registering as a 5.3 magnitude earthquake with an ash plume reaching about 1,200 feet.Read More
