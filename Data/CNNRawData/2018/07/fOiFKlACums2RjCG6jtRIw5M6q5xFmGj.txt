(CNN) Noncitizens in San Francisco, including undocumented immigrants, will be able to vote in November -- but only in local school board elections.San Franciscans in 2016 approved Proposition N, 54% to 46%, extending the right to vote to noncitizens. This week, the city's Department of Elections began issuing voter registration forms so qualifying noncitizens can cast their ballots in the school board elections on November 6.City residents who are of legal voting age, not in prison or on parole for a felony conviction, and are parents, legal guardians, or legally recognized caregivers of children under the age of 19 living in San Francisco, can register to vote in school board elections -- regardless of legal immigration status.The term "noncitizens" encompasses a broad group, including permanent residents, visa holders, people granted asylum or under programs like Temporary Protected Status, among others.Supporters in San Francisco celebrated the occasion Monday at City Hall, citing statistics that one out of three in the city's public schools came from immigrant families.
