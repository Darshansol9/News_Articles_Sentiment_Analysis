(CNN) Baseball fans knew something was up.Minnesota Twins pitcher Fernando Rodney entered Sunday's game against the Tampa Bay Rays in the fifth inning. Rodney, a closer, usually shows up later in a game to finish it out.Pitching that early in a game for the first time in 13 years, Rodney struck out a couple of Rays and then left. Was he injured? Was this part of some bold, new strategy by the Twins?No, nothing that dramatic. Rodney, a native of the Dominican Republic, left the game in Minneapolis early to catch a flight to Miami so he could attend an immigration hearing Monday morning and become a US citizen.In a social media post this week, Rodney proudly displayed his certificate and a US flag.
