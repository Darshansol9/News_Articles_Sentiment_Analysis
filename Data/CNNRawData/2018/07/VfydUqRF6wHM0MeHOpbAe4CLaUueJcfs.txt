Chicago (CNN) The father of a Chicago man who was fatally shot in the back by a police officer last month said he believes video he watched Wednesday shows his son killed in cold blood.Authorities showed body camera and surveillance video of the June 6 incident to the family before releasing it to the media."It's the most terrible feeling you can ever feel, to see one of your children killed, and especially by a policeman who is supposed to serve and protect him," Maurice Granton Sr. said. "Whatever (my son) was doing, it was an arrestable offense."Maurice Granton Jr., 24, never had a gun in his hand, his family and attorneys said. Police said just after the shooting that Granton had a weapon and there was an armed encounter with officers.Videos show Granton running from one officer, eluding that officer by quickly scaling a fence that borders a gravel parking lot, and being shot while on or getting down from a second fence seconds later. Within four minutes, police stand over a pistol about 20 to 30 feet from his body.Maurice Granton Sr. speaks about the death of his son.Read More
