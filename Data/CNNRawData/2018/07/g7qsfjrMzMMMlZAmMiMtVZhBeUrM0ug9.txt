Jenni Schoenberger took the Ride the Ducks tour earlier this week and said she was told they didn't need life jackets.Schoenberger of Spring Hill, Kansas, said the tour didn’t provide a waiver to sign, but the back of her tour ticket says that the user “assumes all risk of personal injuries and property damage or loss.”Schoenberger wrote on Instagram that during the boat safety presentation, the crew told passengers “they have never needed the life jackets before and didn’t plan on using them today.” The boat’s captain, she said, demonstrated the use of a life jacket and told passengers where they were located."He said all of that at once, but mentioned we should protect our electronics 5 or 6 times, which makes me feel like they never anticipated the 'loss' they mention would be people, but that it would just be personal items,” Schoenberger said.She said the boat's captain told passengers the vessel had been inspected by the US Coast Guard and that he was also certified by them. The safety presentation, she said, was brief.With CNN's Maya Eliahou
