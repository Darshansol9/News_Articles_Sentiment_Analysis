(CNN) The Republican Party has proved remarkably malleable ideologically. The party of law and order now has deep distrust of the FBI. The party of free trade is now far more solidly behind protectionism than the Democrats. The party that celebrated President Ronald Reagan's optimism about immigrants now contains a majority that supports separating families at the border and criminally prosecuting undocumented immigrants.Trump's political genius continues to be that he recognizes that the base of the party is ripe for this ideological revolution â€” that while the old Reaganite formula may still be subscribed to by Republican elites in Washington and New York, it's not embraced out there in the grass roots.
