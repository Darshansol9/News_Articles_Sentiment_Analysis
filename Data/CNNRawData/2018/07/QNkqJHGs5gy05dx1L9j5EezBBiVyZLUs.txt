Houston (CNN) Family and friends gathered to honor famed Houston cardiologist Dr. Mark Hausknecht on Saturday, less than two miles from where he was shot to death in broad daylight last week.More than 800 people filled the First Presbyterian Church of Houston, a church official estimated, to remember the doctor whose many patients included former President George H.W.

"It's ironic that when we think about Mark that's the last thing we think about.
