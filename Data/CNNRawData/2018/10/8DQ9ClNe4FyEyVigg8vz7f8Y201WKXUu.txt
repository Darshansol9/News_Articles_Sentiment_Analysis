Tim Hindes sat down shortly after the shooting and began to doodle a revamped Pittsburgh Steelers logo, with the Star of David substituting for the team's yellow star-like design. It's paired with the phrase "Stronger than Hate."The image has quickly become a symbol of solidarity and strength after the deadly attack.Hindes said he was inspired by the shooting and by a friend being the victim of anti-Semitic comments a few days ago."Collectively, those events … drove me to make a message,” Hindes told CNN. “I wanted it to be of resiliency and hope. It was private at first, but friends urged me to make the post public, as it resonated with them.”In a Facebook post, Hindes explained what the symbol meant to him.“Before it was the logo of a globally popular football team, the three diamonds were the seal of a product which helped develop the foundation of many cities across the globe -- steel. Like Pittsburgh and its residents, steel is strong,” he posted to Facebook.“We were strong before this tragedy. A tragedy like this just makes us stronger. Just like you can't break steel, you can't break the resiliency of a Pittsburgher. We are stronger than hate.”Hindes said he doesn’t want credit or accolades for the picture."Use it. Share it. This is an image for Pittsburgh and those who love Pittsburgh," he said.
