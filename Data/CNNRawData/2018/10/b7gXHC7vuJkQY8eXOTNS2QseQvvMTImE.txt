(CNN) Over-pressurized gas lines caused the September 13 fires and explosions in Massachusetts, the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday.One person died , others were injured and 131 structures were damaged in Lawrence, Andover and North Andover, all located north of Boston. More than 60 suspected gas fires broke out, thousands of people were evacuated and 18,000 customers lost power at one point.A house goes up in flames in northeastern Massachusetts north of Boston last month.In its prelimary report , the NTSB said that a Columbia Gas-contracted work crew had removed a cast-iron main that included a gas pressure sensor in South Lawrence. Once that main line was disconnected, the sensing lines began losing pressure.Regulators responded by increasing pressure in the distribution system, the NTSB said. When they didn't detect any system pressure, they allowed the full flow of high-pressure gas into the system, exceeding the maximum allowed.The NTSB said Columbia Gas had developed and approved the work, but did not account for the location of the sensing lines nor require their relocation. Doing so would have ensured regulators could sense the actual system pressure.Read More
