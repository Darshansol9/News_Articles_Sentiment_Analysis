Saudi ArabiaSecretary of State Mike Pompeo briefs President Trump this morning on his meetings with Saudi and Turkish leaders over the disappearance and apparent death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Criticism is mounting over the Trump administration's handling of the crisis, with many saying Trump seems more interested in providing cover for the Saudis than in finding out the truth. Turkish officials say they have evidence that Khashoggi was killed in Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul and that many of the 15 Saudi men implicated in the incident have high-level ties to the Saudi government. Khashoggi's final column for the Washington Post, in which he advocates for freedom of the press in the Middle East, was published last night.2. US deficitPresident Trump asked his Cabinet secretaries to cut their budgets by 5% next year, as his administration tries to get a handle on the rapidly ballooning federal deficit. The deficit jumped to $779 billion in fiscal year 2018. That's up 17% from last year and the highest level since 2012. Republicans blame Democrats, saying they're resistant to cutting spending on social programs. Dems point the finger at the GOP's massive tax cut . Republicans haven't talked much about the deficit or federal debt since Trump took office. But that's all they talked about when Barack Obama was in the Oval Office. CNN's Z. Byron Wolf says the GOP hypocrisy on this is stunning , even by Washington standards.3. Crimea campus attackAt least 18 people died in an attack on a college in Russian-annexed Crimea. The victims, mostly teens, were killed when a bomb exploded in the school's dining room. Many of the dead had also been shot. About 50 others were injured. The suspect in the attack, reportedly a fellow student, killed himself in a library. Authorities first called this a terror attack but later reclassified it as a murder investigation.JUST WATCHED Attack in Crimea kills more than a dozen Replay More Videos ...

Climate changeWant to stroll through the Blue Mosque in Istanbul or ride in a gondola through the canals of Venice? You might want to plan those trips for sooner rather than later. They're just a couple of dozens of World Heritage sites endangered by climate change . A study published this week says the flooding risk in the Mediterranean region will increase by 50% by 2100, while the risk of erosion will jump by 13% during the same period. The impact on historical icons would be significant, unless the world takes action, the study warns.Photos: Historic Mediterranean cities in danger from climate change Historical sites endangered by climate change â€“ The Blue Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey, is one of 156 World Heritage sites in the coastal Mediterranean endangered by the effects of climate change, according to a study published in Nature Communications. Hide Caption 1 of 13 Photos: Historic Mediterranean cities in danger from climate change The Leaning Tower of Pisa and the Cathedral in the "Square of Miracle" in Italy are in danger of flooding by 2100 due to climate change, says a study by the Coastal Risks and Sea-Level Rise Research Group. Hide Caption 2 of 13 Photos: Historic Mediterranean cities in danger from climate change Rising sea levels and increasing erosion, the study said, may endanger historical icons such as this petrified victim of the volcanic eruption of Mont Vesuvius in 79 AD at the archaeological site of Pompeii, in Italy. Hide Caption 3 of 13 Photos: Historic Mediterranean cities in danger from climate change Like Split, Croatia, many of the endangered World Heritage sites sit on or near the water. Our ancestors choose to build there because of the access to fishing and commerce. Hide Caption 4 of 13 Photos: Historic Mediterranean cities in danger from climate change Venice is one of the cities at highest risk of destruction by the effects of climate change. Rising sea waters have flooded the city for centuries, but the study's projections show it could face 8 foot high floods due to rising sea levels within 80 years. Hide Caption 5 of 13 Photos: Historic Mediterranean cities in danger from climate change Due to the steep topography of many of the sites clustered along the Mediterranean Sea, most cities, then and now, were built at the water's edge. Hide Caption 6 of 13 Photos: Historic Mediterranean cities in danger from climate change The Avenue of the Knights in the medieval Old Town of Rhodes, Greece, is also in danger. "If our common heritage is destroyed or lost, it is not possible to replace or rebuild it," said lead study author Lena Reimann, a doctoral researcher for the Coastal Risks and Sea-Level Rise Research Group in Germany.

Hide Caption 9 of 13 Photos: Historic Mediterranean cities in danger from climate change The beautiful villages in the "Cinque Terre" area of Italy are at high risk by the year 2100 from erosion caused by climate change, according to the study. Hide Caption 10 of 13 Photos: Historic Mediterranean cities in danger from climate change The ancient city of Ephesus is one of the sites in greatest danger from future erosion caused by climate change, said the study. Ephesus was an Ancient Greek city, but excavations of the site have revealed grand monuments from the Roman Imperial period including the remains of the famous Temple of Artemis, the Great Theatre and the Library of Celsus.
