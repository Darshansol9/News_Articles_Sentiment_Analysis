(CNN) Citing a maritime law from the 1850s, the companies that operated a duck boat that sank during a fierce storm in July, killing 17 people, have filed paperwork asking a federal court to rule they have little or no liability for the incident.The companies said the legal maneuver, filed in Missouri, will consolidate the civil actions against them and they plan to mediate settlements with survivors and families of the victims.But one woman who survived the sinking as nine of her family members perished said the court filing finding her relatives "worthless is incredibly hurtful and insensitive."Ripley Entertainment, which operates Branson Duck Vehicles, says in its court complaint filed Monday that an 1851 law limits its liability because the amphibious vessel was properly maintained and prepared for the voyage and after the sinking it is a total loss.JUST WATCHED Survivor: Husband's memory will keep me going Replay More Videos ...
