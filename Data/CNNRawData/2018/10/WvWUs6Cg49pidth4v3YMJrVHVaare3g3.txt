(CNN) The sons of a woman who sent an awkward viral tweet are defusing the situation with laughter -- and a little bit of debunking.On Monday night, a relatively benign political tweet from a random mom on Twitter exploded into a huge meme. Her tweet featured a photo of her son, along with a message that seemed to criticize recent national conversations about sexual assault and accountability."This is MY son," the now-deleted tweet read. "He graduated #1 in boot camp. He was awarded the USO award. He was #1 in A school. He is a gentleman who respects women. He won't go on solo dates due to the current climate of false sexual accusations by radical feminists with an axe to grind. I VOTE. #HimToo."since she deleted it here's a screenshot. one of the greatest posts of all time pic.twitter.com/Z6TUKOjH9T — KT NELSON (@KrangTNelson) October 8, 2018The cadence of the diatribe, along with the Rockwellian image of said sailor son in uniform, were easy pickings for Twitter pranksters. They copy and pasted the tweet text, interchanging the picture with images of Buster Bluth from "Arrested Development," Gritty the Philadelphia Flyers mascot, and countless other meme-y figures.This is my son. He is a gentleman who treats ladies with respect. He's afraid to date right now because of the current climate. Seriously, because of the actual climate his future kids won't be able to survive. I vote. #HimToo pic.twitter.com/pxefN68aNZ — Luna Malbroux (@LunaisAmerica) October 9, 2018There was only one problem with the whole thing. According to two men who claim to be the woman's sons, the son in the photo is not, in fact, afraid of feminists or dates or false sexual accusations at all.
