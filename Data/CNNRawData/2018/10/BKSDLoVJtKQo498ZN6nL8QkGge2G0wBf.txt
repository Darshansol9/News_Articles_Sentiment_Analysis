(CNN) Three Florida police officers were sentenced to prison this week for intentionally making false arrests for burglary, according to the Department of Justice.Former Biscayne Park Police Chief Raimundo Atesiano worked with three former officers, Guillermo Ravelo, Charlie Dayoub and Raul Fernandez to falsely arrest several victims to keep their burglary clearance rate at 100%, according to the Department of Justice. One of the victims was a teenager.Throughout Atesiano's tenure as the Biscayne Park police chief, he encouraged officers to falsely arrest individuals with no evidence or probable cause to cover for all reported burglaries, according to the DOJ."These three police officers from Biscayne Park disgraced themselves and damaged the public's trust in law enforcement," Special Agent in Charge of FBI Miami Robert F. Lasky said in a statement.Following directions from Atesiano, Ravelo falsely arrested a victim known as "C.D." in January 2013, and another victim identified as "E.B." in February 2014, on burglary charges without any legal standing, according to the Department of Justice.Read More
