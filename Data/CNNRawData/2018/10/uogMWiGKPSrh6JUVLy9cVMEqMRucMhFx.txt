(CNN) Four alleged members of a militant white supremacist group have been charged with inciting rioting and assaulting counterprotesters at last year's deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.Prosecutors described the men as "serial rioters" who attend political rallies to engage in violence against those who disagree with them.The complaint identified the defendants as members and associates of the Rise Above Movement, a militant white supremacist organization based in Southern California, who traveled to Virginia in August last year to protest the removal of the Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson statues in Charlottesville.Rise Above Movement members openly identify themselves on social media as "alt-right" and "nationalist" and frequently post videos and photos of themselves in public parks performing physical training and mixed martial arts street-fighting techniques "in order to prepare to engage in fighting and violence at political rallies," the complaint said.The group espouses anti-Semitism and violence toward those who "hold opposite ideologies to their own," according to the complaint, which includes numerous photos of the defendants engaging in violence at rallies.Read More
