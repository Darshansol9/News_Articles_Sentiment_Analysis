(CNN) A week after a 13-year-old girl vanished, a local sheriff is seeking a cadre of volunteers that's equivalent to two-thirds of the population of the small Wisconsin city near the teenager's home.Barron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald on Monday asked for 2,000 volunteers to help authorities in an expanded routine search of the area around the crime scene Tuesday for possible evidence in the investigation into Jayme Closs' disappearance. The teenager vanished early October 15 and her parents were found fatally shot in their home near the city of Barron in northwestern Wisconsin. Barron, a city of less 3 square miles , has a population of about 3,300, according to US Census figures.Monday's call for volunteers is 10 times the number of volunteers the sheriff sought last week. Fitzgerald said more people are needed to help search a bigger area.The sheriff also released photos of two "vehicles of interest" captured on surveillance footage near the Closs home during the killings.The first vehicle is likely a red or orange 2008-2014 Dodge Challenger, Fitzgerald said. The second vehicle is likely either a black 2006-2010 Ford Edge or a black 2004-2010 Acura MDX, he said.Read More
