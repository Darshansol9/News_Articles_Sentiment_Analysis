(CNN) Convicted domestic abusers will no longer be able to legally have firearms in New York state, according to legislation signed Tuesday by Gov. Andrew Cuomo."With this legislation, we can sever the undeniable connection between domestic abuse and deadly gun violence, and continue to build upon the strongest gun laws in the nation," Cuomo said."Women in this country are 16 times more likely to be killed with a gun than women in the other developing nations," Cuomo said.
