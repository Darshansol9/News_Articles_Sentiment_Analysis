(CNN) Michigan State University knew of allegations of "inappropriate remarks" made by Larry Nassar's one-time boss in 2015 but reinstated him as dean anyway during a review process, university Provost June Youatt said in a statement Wednesday.William Strampel, the former dean of the university's College of Osteopathic Medicine, also used "uncouth and sometimes offensive language," and the matter was discussed with him before his reinstatement for another term, Youatt said."The concerns raised were taken seriously, and I specifically addressed these in the required post-review conversation," Youatt said in the statement. "At that point, no complaints had been filed with OIE (Office of Institutional Equity) or MSUPD (university police) regarding Strampel's behavior."There was no immediate comment from Strampel's attorney.JUST WATCHED Larry Nassar's former boss charged with felony Replay More Videos ...
