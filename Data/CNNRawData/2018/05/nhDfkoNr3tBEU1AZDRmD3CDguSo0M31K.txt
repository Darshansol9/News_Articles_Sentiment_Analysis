(CNN) President Donald Trump declared a major disaster in Hawaii after days of volcanic activity that sent molten lava and toxic fumes spewing into residential neighborhoods.The declaration allows federal assistance to supplement state and local recovery efforts in areas affected by the Kilauea volcanic eruption and earthquake.Federal funding is available to state, eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis, the White House said.The Kilauea volcano erupted May 3, leaving the future of hundreds of people in Hawaii's Big Island uncertain.The threat of violent explosions prompted authorities to close the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on Friday until further notice.
