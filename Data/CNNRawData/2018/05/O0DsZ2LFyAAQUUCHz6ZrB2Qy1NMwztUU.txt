(CNN) Several thousand ancient artifacts are being returned to Iraq after they were falsely labeled as "tile samples" and illegally smuggled to the US retailer Hobby Lobby, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, said this week.The move comes after ICE and the Justice Department last year brought a civil action against Hobby Lobby, saying it had received thousands of falsely labeled Iraqi artifacts from a United Arab Emirates-based supplier. Hobby Lobby in July agreed to forfeit the artifacts and pay a $3 million fine to resolve the action.In all, ICE returned 3,800 ancient artifacts, including cuneiform tablets, cylinder seals and clay bullae."We will continue to work together to prevent the looting of antiquities and ensure that those who would attempt to profit from this crime are held accountable," ICE Acting Director Thomas Homan said .

"You have to understand that in Iraq, memories are long, and so we really have a sense of kinship to these artifacts."Read More
