(CNN) Survivors of Larry Nassar's abuse say USA Gymnastics coach Martha Karolyi knew in 2015 that the team doctor had been accused of molesting young girls at the training center that bears the Karolyi name.But she never reported the allegations to Texas authorities and should face charges, the women's lawyers say.Gymnasts who say they were molested by Nassar at the famed Karolyi Ranch are expected to speak in a news conference on Thursday to demand criminal sanctions for Martha Karolyi and her husband, Bela Karolyi. Other survivors who were abused by Nassar at Michigan State University are also expected to speak.The couple, who have denied any wrongdoing, ran the training center, a 2,000-acre compound about 70 miles north of Houston. It became the US Women's National Team Training Center in 2001 and a US Olympic Training Site in 2011 -- during many of the same years Nassar was the national team doctor.The Texas Rangers are leading an "open and very active" investigation into possible misconduct at the ranch, said prosecutor Stephanie Stroud of the Walker County District Attorney's Office. The office will likely bring evidence to a grand jury "before the end of the summer," she said.
