(CNN) It's been four weeks since the first eruptions from the Kilauea volcano rocked Hawaii's Big Island, and the lava is as relentless as ever.Since the first eruption occurred in the Leilani Estates subdivision on the evening of Thursday, May 3, emergency officials believe nearly 2,500 residents have been forced to evacuate as lava, flowing from numerous volcanic fissures, consumes everything in its path.Whatever residents were left in the neighborhood were ordered out on Thursday by Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim."Persons in violation of this order are subject to arrest and will be liable for any costs associated with rescue operations in the mandatory evacuation area," the county said on its website.At least 75 structures have been destroyed, according to Hawaii Civil Defense spokesman Talmadge Magno. About 20 of those burned down earlier this week.
