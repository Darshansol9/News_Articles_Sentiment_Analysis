Arizona Educators United wanted a 20% raise for teachers by next school year and yearly raises after that until Arizona's teacher salaries reach the national average.The group also wanted lawmakers to restore education funding to pre-recession 2008 levels and demanded no new tax cuts until per-student spending reached the national average. It laid out a goal of limiting class sizes to 23 students per classWhat they got: It took six days, but Arizona teachers ended their walkout after the governor signed an education funding bill into law.The measure, dubbed the "#20x2020" plan, raises teachers' pay by 20% over the next three years. The new law also increases funding for support staff, new textbooks, upgraded technology and infrastructure, which will help make up for recession-era cuts.What's going to happen next: While many teachers cheered the wins, some said the fight will continue.Arizona Educators United pointed out that several teacher-supported amendments didn't pass -- like lowering the student-counselor ratio from 900:1 to 250:1."Overall the general consensus among teachers seems to be that this was a small win for now with many, many huge battles ahead," teacher Christina Waters tweeted.ColoradoWhat teachers wanted: The Colorado Education Association wanted more education funding and a sustainable fix to The Colorado Education Association wanted more education funding and a sustainable fix to PERA , the state's public employees retirement program.Teachers were especially angry because Colorado basically underfunded schools this year by $828 million , the education association said. That's because Colorado hasn't kept up with a state constitutional mandate to increase funds each year by at least the rate of inflation.In addition to the statewide protest, teachers in Pueblo launched their own strike against the Pueblo City School District for five daysWhat they got: The Colorado Education Association said its legislative agenda The Colorado Education Association said its legislative agenda largely succeeded "to ultimately provide better outcomes for students -- with the exception of PERA."The retirement program bill calls for increasing employee contributions and raises the age of retirement for new people in the system to 64.While the state protest had mixed results, the local teachers' strike in Pueblo was victorious. After five days, the teachers won concessions from the district such as a 2.5% cost of living adjustment for the next school year and a new health insurance contribution.What's going to happen next: The Colorado Education Association said it's pleased with recent bills to help the teacher shortage -- especially in rural areas, where attracting and retaining teachers is difficult"These bills are a start at tackling our growing educator shortage and we will look to build on this momentum next session."North CarolinaWhat teachers wanted: Although North Carolina teachers received raises in recent years, they were frustrated that Although North Carolina teachers received raises in recent years, they were frustrated that they've lost 9.4% in pay since 2009, when adjusted for inflation .

Ditto for per-student funding."School funding is the same thing -- in a lot of states, it hasn't (reached) the same level of funding that it was before the recession," said Kency Nittler, manager of teacher trends for the National Council on Teacher Quality.Eskelsen Garcia lauded the victories made by teachers across the country this year."West Virginia will now be able to attract and retain the best educators for their students. Oklahoma students and educators will see an additional half a billion dollars in resources for their classrooms, the largest education budget increase in state history. Arizona students now have a road map to smaller class sizes and educators that will be compensated at a livable level," Eskelsen Garcia said."But there's still plenty of work to be done," she said. "If we don't see continual improvements in how state leaders prioritize our students, there will be accountability in November."
