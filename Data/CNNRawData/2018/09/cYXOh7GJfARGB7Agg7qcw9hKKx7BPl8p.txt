(CNN) A reality check in the form of a young girl frozen in fear, hiding under her desk is making its way around the country.The bronze-coated statue was created by Manuel Oliver, who lost his son Joaquin in the shooting at Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February. The poignant statue depicts a young girl hiding for her life during a lockdown procedure. The statue is called "The Last Lockdown.""We called it 'The Last Lockdown' because that's the ultimate goal. We want to help take a step toward a world where we have already seen the last time that this has to happen," Sean Leonard, one of its creative directors, told CNN.Leonard and Daniel Crumrine, both Texas-based creative advertising directors, worked to create what Crumrine calls this "gut-punch" of a sculpture. They worked with the Giffords Organization , a gun-reform nonprofit started by former US representative and mass shooting survivor Gabrielle "Gabby" Giffords of Arizona.The top of the desk shows staggering statistics about gun violence in America.The project will include nine other identical sculptures that will be featured across 10 cities in the United States. Some of the locations include the Center for Social Justice in Las Vegas, Houston's City Hall and Philadelphia's Museum of Art.Read More
