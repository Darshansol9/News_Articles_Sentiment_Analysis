Lumberton, North Carolina (CNN) The city of Lumberton, North Carolina, doesn't want a repeat of Hurricane Matthew.Two years ago, the city about 70 miles northwest of Wilmington was submerged in water for days after the Category 1 storm slammed into North Carolina. Part of the reason, citizens and officials said, was because of a spot where a train track runs under Interstate 95. The underpass left a gap in the surrounding levee, which allowed water from Lumber River to flood into the southwest part of the city. The entire area was navigable only by boat, said state Sen. Danny Britt.This is where water flooded into the city of Lumberton, NC two yrs ago during Hurricane Matthew. Volunteers, city employees and the National Guard worked furiously today to "put a cork in this hole," as the deputy dir of public works Corey Walters put it to me today pic.twitter.com/wJyYVE9Kne â€” Cassie Spodak (@CassieSpodak) September 14, 2018"This is the one low point in Lumberton's levee system," Corey Walters, Lumberton's deputy director of public works, told CNN on Friday. "This is essentially what flooded Lumberton."To prevent another catastrophe, city officials knew the hole had to be plugged, especially with Hurricane Florence slamming North Carolina's coast. Officials had been working to secure the area for the last couple of days, but were struggling. On Friday, they put out a call on Facebook to ask for volunteers to help fill sandbags and plug the gap.An hour later, more than 100 people were at work. The group was made up of city employees, members of the National Guard and about 70 citizens who were hard at work, trudging through the mud as rain whipped around them.Read More
