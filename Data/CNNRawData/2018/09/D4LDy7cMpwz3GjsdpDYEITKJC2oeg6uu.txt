(CNN) The mother accused of killing her 2-year-old son in Largo, Florida, has been charged with first-degree murder and child abuse.Charisse Stinson reported her son missing earlier this week and an Amber Alert was issued for Jordan Belliveau on Monday. The mother said she had been attacked and when she woke up, her little boy was gone.Police believe it was all a lie."In interviewing the mother last night, she made significant admissions into what had happened to her child, which led us to have probable cause to arrest her in the death," Largo police Lt. Randall Chaney said Wednesday at a news conference.Stinson said that during a moment of frustration she struck Jordan in the face with the back of her hand after he had suffered a serious injury to his right leg, according to an arrest affidavit. His head struck a wall and he suffered seizures during the night. As his health declined the next day, Stinson carried him to a wooded area and left him there, police said.Read More
