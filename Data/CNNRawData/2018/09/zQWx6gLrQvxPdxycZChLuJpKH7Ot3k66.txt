(CNN) School is expected to resume in Vancouver, Washington on Wednesday after teachers reached a tentative agreement for a new contract, according to a statement on the school district's website.The Vancouver Education Association will vote Tuesday on a new contract for teachers, counselors and other education professionals that was agreed upon by their representatives Sunday, Vancouver Public Schools said."Unlike other districts that only had to address teacher salaries, VEA and VPS had to negotiate an entire contract," said VPS Superintendent Steve Webb. "I am grateful to the bargaining teams for working very hard together to come to an agreement. And, I especially want to thank our teachers and staff, parents and community members for their patience and understanding as we completed this difficult process."The district, which serves 24,000 students, said details of the agreement would be released after ratification.Vancouver is one of a number of Washington school districts where educators were on strike last week. The Vancouver school district's announcement of an agreement follows Friday's news that teachers in Seattle had also reached a tentative deal to start school September 5 as scheduled in that district.
