We didn't know where to go," she said.Another woman who was rescued by another group in New Bern told CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360˚" that she and her family thought they would be safe in their brick home and heard the storm had been downgraded from a Category 4."About 11:30, 12 (midnight), the water came into the house. It came in slowly but then it just steady, just kept rising," Annazette Riley-Cromartie said.She, her husband and three children went up into the attic for a while, but the winds howled and the family descended to an upper floor bedroom.As they waited for emergency workers, they heard neighbors calling for help.Her husband went to see if he could assist them but the water was chest high, she said."It's the worst feeling in the world to hear people yelling for help and you can't do anything," she said.Eventually a citizen rescue crew came with a boat.An area in downtown Wilmington, North Carolina, usually meant for street parking and relaxing on park benches is inundated by water from the swollen Cape Fear River.Swift-water rescue teams from out of state helped local rescuers evacuate people whenever conditions allowed.
