[Hermann] Goering stole paintings from private collections from different museums around Europe, he needed an expert to verify them," said Sulitzer after the painting was unveiled."Deux Femmes Dans Un Jardin" was painted in 1919.

It subsequently found its way to London, where it was sold again in 1977, and then appeared at a sale in Zurich, Switzerland, in 1999."Finally, the painting ended up in Christie's Gallery in New York, where it was put up for auction by a private collector in 2013.1 / 22 The "Apollo and Venus" painting by 16th-century Dutch master Otto van Veen (1556-1629) was discovered in the closet of an art gallery in Iowa, and is likely worth over $4 million.Scroll through the gallery for other examples of lost and found artworks.

Hopefully this event brings some measure of justice to Madame Sylvie Sulitzer and her family."How do art auctions really work?"It's an amazing decision and I am very thankful to show my beloved family, wherever they are, that after all what they've been through, there is a justice," said Sulitzer.Christie's said that in 2013, when the painting was consigned, it was estimated to be worth between $150,000 and $200,000.Berman said, "I'd rather not speculate on the worth of the painting. Suffice it to say that Madame Sulitzer believes that it is priceless."The painting will be on display in the gallery of the Museum of Jewish Heritage: A Living Memorial to the Holocaust until September 16.
