(CNN) Jevh Maravilla just wanted an order of fries, and to see more Asians on the posters at his favorite McDonald's.After placing an order at the fast-food chain in Pearland, Texas, Maravilla noticed the store didn't have a single advertising poster that represented him or his friends.Bothered by the lack of Asian representation at a place he goes to often, he took it upon himself to fix it. About $100 later, the local chain now has a poster of two Filipinos enjoying some Mickey D's."I noticed there was a blank wall at McDonald's, so I decided to make this fake poster of me and my friend," Maravilla tweeted, along with a photo of the two friends sitting by the poster.The fake advertisement was hung up on July 13, and after 51 days, Maravilla thought it would be a good idea to share their mischief with the world. The world responded: his tweet had more than 900,000 likes and was shared over 237,000 times.Read More
