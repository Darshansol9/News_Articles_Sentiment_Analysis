Damaging effects from the storm are expected to be felt far inland, particularly as it's projected to stall once it crosses the coastline.A big worry with Florence is that the system could linger for days , similar to the manner in whch Harvey hovered over Texas last year. That means high rainfall totals and consequent inland flooding could become a huge concern.The current forecast from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration calls for more than 20 inches of rain where the storm makes landfall. But more than 10 inches is forecast for a larger area, including most of eastern North Carolina inland to just north of Richmond, Virginia.Read More
