On Tuesday afternoon, Bill Cosby was processed at the Montgomery Correctional Facility in Eagleville, Pennsylvania after being sentenced to 3-10 years in a state prison. He was also fined $25,000 plus the costs of prosecution.Not long after, Cosby was then moved to State Correctional Institution at Phoenix, a state prison, for diagnostic and intake. There, his needs and health issues will be evaluated as officials decide which prison best suits him overall.This process, which every inmate in the state prison system goes through, could take anywhere from weeks to months, Amy Worden of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections told CNN last week. Several factors go into this overall evaluation, including the prisoner's age and Sexually Violent Predator assessment.“The department of corrections has had high profile inmates before, and I’m sure we’ll have them again, so it’s not that much out of the ordinary," Worden said."He’ll be treated like other inmates."See video of Cosby's arrival at the Eagleville facility:This post was updated.
