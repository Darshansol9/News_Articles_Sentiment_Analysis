(CNN) The judge set to sentence Bill Cosby next week on three counts of aggravated indecent assault denied a defense motion Wednesday to remove himself from the case and reverse an order that allowed the trial to take place.The comedian's lawyers filed a motion last week arguing that Judge Steven O'Neill was biased because of a past political campaign and "nasty" personal conflict with prior district attorney, Bruce Castor.In 2016, Castor testified there was a binding agreement that Cosby could not be prosecuted, but O'Neill disagreed, ruling the case could go forwardIn Wednesday's ruling, the court found the motion was not filed in a timely fashion, but even still had no merit.
