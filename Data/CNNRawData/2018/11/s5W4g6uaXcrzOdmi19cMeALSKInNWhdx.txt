(CNN) The school resource officer, criticized for not entering the building to confront the Parkland shooter, will not testify in an investigation of the shooting.Scot Peterson's lawyer, Joseph DiRuzzo III, told CNN that the former resource officer was subpoenaed to testify before a state commission investigating the February school shooting that left 17 people dead. DiRuzzo filed a three-point suit on Thursday to fight that subpoena and keep his client from having to appear at this week's hearings.The suit lists Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School Safety Commission, the chair of the commission Bob Gualtieri and commissioner of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement Richard L. Swearingen as the defendants. DiRuzzo alleges that the commission has abused the process and veered from its original purpose of finding facts to serving "personal agendas of the Commission members."Gov. Rick Scott authorized the commission, according to the lawsuit, to "at a minimum" investigate the response to the shooting and make recommendations to improve the process going forward.The complaint alleges that the commission has suppressed facts of the case that has become a "de facto criminal investigation"-- resulting in what they claim is an unconstitutional subpoena of Peterson.Read More
