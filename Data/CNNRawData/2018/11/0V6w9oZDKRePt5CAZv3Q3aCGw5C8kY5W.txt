(CNN) A significant storm system could bring adverse weather conditions to several key states on Election Day, which occurs across the country next Tuesday.Weather forecast models are showing an area of low pressure moving through the Midwest into the Great Lakes, along with a trailing cold front that would spark numerous storms all the way down to the Gulf Coast.Every state east of the Mississippi River could see rain on Tuesday, though some states will undoubtedly see more storms, and potentially disruptive weather, than others.The strongest storms, which could be severe and contain hail, damaging winds and even the potential for tornadoes, will be located just ahead of the advancing cold front.
