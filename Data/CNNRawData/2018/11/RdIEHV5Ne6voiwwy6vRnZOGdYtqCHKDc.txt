(CNN) Since September, 13 dead California sea lions have washed up in Puget Sound near Seattle, a conservation group says. Eight of the sea lions were shot, and the rest died from other wounds, most likely also caused by humans.The Seal Sitters Marine Mammal Stranding Network, a volunteer organization that responds to calls for stranded animals, said all the sea lions died from acute trauma -- including one found last week that had its head sliced off.It's not uncommon for sea lions to get shot -- most often by fishermen who believe the animals are reducing salmon populations and harming their livelihood. But the current spate of sea lion shootings is much higher than usual for the months of September through November, the Seal Sitters group says.And the organization said this is just the beginning.
