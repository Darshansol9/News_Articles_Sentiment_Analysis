Chico, California (CNN) First they were driven from their homes by the deadly Camp Fire in Northern California. Now, if it rains, they could be flooded out of their tent city, which has sprung up in a Walmart parking lot.That possibility of flooding from rain is one concern that has authorities working to relocate the estimated hundreds of wildfire evacuees who have taken refuge at the parking lot 10 minutes down the hill from the town of Paradise, which is now little more than acres of charred ruins.People displaced by the Camp Fire have set up tents outside a Walmart store.As thousands of people packed into shelters in Butte County after their homes were destroyed, many others were left without a place to go. The Walmart in Chico was where many Paradise residents shopped, a familiar place where they felt safe and comfortable. So they slept there in tents and cars.What started as a temporary shelter for those escaping the fire has turned into a makeshift village. Volunteers have been stationed at the parking lot handing out everything from smoke masks to dog food to clothes and other essentials.There are several portable toilets on site, although people have to go elsewhere to shower. A whiteboard on site tells people where else they can go to find shelter and lists names of those missing from the fire. A poster provides information about free available shuttles, discount codes for Lyft rides and the number to call if longer rides are needed.Read More
