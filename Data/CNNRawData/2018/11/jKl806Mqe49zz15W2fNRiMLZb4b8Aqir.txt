(CNN) A federal judge may have given one of the planet's most endangered wolf species a glimmer of hope for survival.In a searing decision aimed at the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Chief Judge Terrence W. Boyle ruled that the agency violated the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Protection Act by neglecting its duty to protect the rare North Carolina red wolf.There are only an estimated 40 red wolves remaining in the wild, confined to a refuge spanning five counties in northeastern North Carolina.In his ruling, Judge Boyle wrote that the USFWS's decision to stop previously successful techniques for managing the red wolf population "amount to a failure (to) comply with its affirmative duty," and that revisions to its red wolf management policy were overly influenced by public pressure to stop recovery efforts.The judge, of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, also made permanent a 2016 injunction which prevents the USFWS from capturing and killing red wolves without first showing that the animals are a threat to human, livestock or pet safety.Read More
