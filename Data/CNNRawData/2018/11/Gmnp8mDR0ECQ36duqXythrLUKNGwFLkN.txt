(CNN) Some Pittsburgh polling stations on Tuesday handed out voting stickers that reflected the mood of a grieving and healing city.Polling places near Tree of Life synagogue, where a gunman killed 11 Jews on October 27 in the worst anti-Semitic attack in US history, distributed the now familiar "Stronger Than Hate" stickers featuring a modified version of the Steelers logo, according to Jeanne Clark, chair of the Shadyside Democratic Committee, who said she came up with the idea.On the sticker, the yellow star is substituted with the Jewish Star of David."Obviously we've been having a tough time here in Pittsburgh," Clark told CNN Tuesday evening. "I've been trying to figure out how we can support one another."Her answer: Voting stickers honoring the massacre victims. A friend handled the design, she said. Some 15,000 were printed.
