(CNN) Janine McClenny was touched when the story of a homeless man who gave the last of his money to a young woman stranded on the interstate came across her newsfeed."It tugged at my heartstrings," McClenny told CNN.Fortunately for everyone moved by the story, the woman and her boyfriend -- Kate McClure and Mark D'Amico -- started a GoFundMe campaign to repay Johnny Bobbitt Jr. many times over.He gave $20 to the stranded woman.McClenny gave $20 to him.But McClenny and others were the victims of a heartwarming tale predicated on a lie, according to Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina.She's one of 14,000 donors GoFundMe now has to refund after the couple and Bobbitt were charged with second-degree theft by deception and conspiracy to commit theft by deception, according to Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina."The story now in hindsight sounds a little unbelievable," McClenny said. "I think I should have thought harder before I decided to give people some of my money."How did it all fall apart?All it took was a picture and a good story.McClure and D'Amico were unable to pay their bills and had mounting debt, their texts show.Then, they met a veteran, Bobbitt Jr., on an off-ramp, Coffina said.They went back a month later to get a picture with Bobbitt, who already had what Coffina called a story "remarkably similar" to the one the three would peddle on his Facebook page."Okay so wait the gas part is completely made up, but the guy isn't. I had to make something up to make people feel bad," McClure told a friend in one of the more than 67,000 text messages investigators reviewed.And, it seems, people did feel bad. The campaign brought in more than $400,000 in donations. After fees, the proceeds of the campaign netted about $367,000, all deposited into McClure's accounts, Coffina said.And they might have gotten away with it, too, Coffina said, had they not gone to court.Bobbitt sued the couple in August , claiming he did not get his fair share and that the money he was promised had disappeared.That lawsuit invited a search warrant, a deposition and an investigation into their campaign, which uncovered the conspiracy and the three were taken into custody.What happens next?This kind of misuse is extremely rare, GoFundMe said in a statement. But, the company says they are "fully cooperating" with law enforcement and has confirmed that donors will receive a refund.McClenny said she now feels foolish for donating, but that the revelation hasn't totally dissuaded her from giving to charity."If I come across something that I think it's worthy then I might donate," she said. "It may change the way I donate in the future... but I think that GoFundMe is still very important to help people."
