(CNN) As Thousand Oaks comes to grips with the dual traumas of a deadly mass shooting and destructive wildfires, Brian Hynes will have to decide whether to reopen the Southern California bar where 12 people were killed.The Borderline Bar & Grill, the kind of place that comforted and supported the community in times of distress, is closed after a Marine veteran opened fire there last week in what authorities called a "horrific scene" before he apparently took his own life.Will the bar reopen? Hynes, the establishment's owner, said he knows how he'll come to a decision."With what Borderline is to ... my community, I don't know if (reopening) is going to feel right. But once I stand inside that building, it's going to be like going to my childhood home, and I'll know. I'll know then," he told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Monday afternoon."There's no way I'm not going to reopen out of fear or anything like that. If it works, we will definitely reopen, but right now ... with the fires going on in our same community ... I'm trying to get people back in their home beds, with their pets and their families."
