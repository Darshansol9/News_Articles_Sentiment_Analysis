(CNN) More than 30 people knew about confessed Parkland gunman Nikolas Cruz's troubling behavior, but didn't report it until after he killed 17 students and teachers at his former school, investigators found.Several people knew of Cruz's threats of violence, tendency to mutilate animals and expressed desire to commit a school shooting, an investigator told the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public Safety Commission during a hearing on Tuesday in Sunrise, Florida. They also knew he had knives and firearms, the investigator said."Over a really extended period of time, a lot of people saw Cruz's behavior -- very troubling behavior," said commission chair, Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri. "And in many cases, that probably should have caused them to report what they saw, heard or learned, but for a variety of reasons they did not.""The phrase, 'See Something, Say Something,' it means something, and it has to be more than a phrase," the sheriff said.Cruz, 20, was arrested shortly after the shooting on February 14 and has confessed to being the gunman, court documents show. He is awaiting trial on 17 counts of premeditated murder and 17 counts of attempted murder. Prosecutors have said they plan to seek the death penalty
