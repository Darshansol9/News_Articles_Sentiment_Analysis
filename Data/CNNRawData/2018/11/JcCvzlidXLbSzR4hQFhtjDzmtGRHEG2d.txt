(CNN) The death of a missing 6-year-old boy with autism whose body was found in a North Carolina creek in September has been classified as a "probable drowning," according to an autopsy report from the Mecklenburg County Medical Examiner.Maddox's body was found five days later in a creek about a mile east of Rankin Lake Park, where he was last seen with his father and a friend, authorities said."The findings are not inconsistent with drowning," the medical examiner's report said. "In conjunction with investigative information at this time, which gives no indication of other than an accidental drowning, it seems reasonable to conclude that the likely cause of death is drowning."The body was partially submerged in 2 to 3 feet of water. The area, thick with underbrush, had been searched numerous times.Read More
