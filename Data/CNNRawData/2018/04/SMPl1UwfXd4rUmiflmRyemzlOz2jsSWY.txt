(CNN) Almost 28 years after it was launched, NASA's intrepid Hubble Space Telescope just keeps illuminating distant reaches of the universe.Thanks to a phenomenon called gravitational lensing , Hubble has helped astronomers set an out-of-this-world record by spotting the farthest individual star ever seen.The massive blue star, located in a remote spiral galaxy, has the catchy official name of MACS J1149+2223 Lensed Star-1. Luckily for us, scientists have given it a nickname: Icarus, after the character from Greek mythology who flew too close to the sun.What's most interesting about this discovery is that it is a single star, said lead researcher Patrick Kelly, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities.Icarus is only visible because it is being magnified by the gravity of a massive galaxy cluster. The inset panels at right show the view in 2011, before Icarus was visible, compared with the star's brightening in 2016."This is the first time we're seeing a magnified, individual star," Kelly said in a statement. "You can see individual galaxies out there, but this star is at least 100 times farther away than the next individual star we can study, except for supernova explosions."Read More
