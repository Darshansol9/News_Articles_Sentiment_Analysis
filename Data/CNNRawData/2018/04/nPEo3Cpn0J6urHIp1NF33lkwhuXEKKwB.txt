Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (CNN) This is a battle that could shutter some classrooms indefinitely.Hundreds of Oklahoma teachers filled the state Capitol for a second day Tuesday, demanding an additional $150 million in school funding and increased raises for themselves and support staff.Their walkout comes days after the state approved some raises and school funding -- but only a fraction of what the teachers' union demanded.So despite school cancellations and even the risk of discipline from some districts, teachers say they won't budge.The line outside to get into the state Capitol is long. Some tell me they'be waited at least 2 hours to get in so their voices heard. pic.twitter.com/Eb0ueNRndT — Nick Valencia (@CNNValencia) April 3, 2018"We will hold the line until hell freezes over, and then we will be here on ice skates," Muskogee High School teacher Diane Walker said.
