(CNN) The mystery of what happened in the Hart family's fatal crash off a California cliffside remains under investigation.But much of the family's troubled history leading up to that point is known, and it provides vital clues to understanding why Mendocino County Sheriff Tom Allman said he is investigating the case as a crime.The bodies of Jennifer and Sarah Hart, both 38, were found inside their SUV March 26. The bodies of children Markis, 19, and Jeremiah and Abigail, both 14, were found nearby.But there has been no trace of Devonte, 15, Hannah, 16, and Sierra, 12, and authorities now believe the three missing children were also in the vehicle.An in-depth look at the Harts' past steps reveals a complicated picture of a couple with six adopted children, allegations of child abuse, an investigation from Child Protective Services and a fatal drive off a cliff.September 2006Jennifer and Sarah Hart are a couple living in Minnesota.Siblings Markis, Abigail and Hannah are adopted from Colorado County, Texas, according to Tiffani Butler of the state's Department of Family and Protective Services.It's unclear whether one or both of the Hart women adopted the kids.September 2008Police in Alexandria, Minnesota, receive a call about a 6-year-old child, whose name and gender is redacted, with a bruise on the left arm, according to Alexandria police records. The child indicated to staff that the mother, Jennifer Hart, struck the child's arm with a belt.Police and social services interview the Hart parents."They say (the child) has been constantly going through food issues, where (child) will steal people's food at school or eat out of garbage cans or off the floor," according to the police report.The parents also say they do not know how the bruise got on the child's arm, but the state says that the child had fallen down eight stairs in the house a few days earlier.The case is closed from a legal standpoint, according to the police report.February 2009Siblings Jeremiah, Sierra and Devonte are officially adopted from Harris County, Texas, Butler said.In adoption cases, children live with the potential legal guardians for six months before adoption goes through.

Officials arrive just after Jennifer Hart comes home from work, but she does not answer the door.March 24Traveling in a 2003 GMC Yukon XL, the Hart family is in and around Newport, Oregon, around 8:15 a.m., according to police.They drive south along US 101 until they reach Leggett, California, and then travel south along state Route 1 until reaching Fort Bragg around 8 p.m. They remain in Fort Bragg for about a day, authorities said.March 25Jennifer Hart is seen on surveillance footage shopping at a Safeway in Fort Bragg.

Three of their children, Markis, Jeremiah and Abigail, are found dead outside the car.The vehicle had to have traveled 75 to 100 feet on a dirt turnout next to the highway before it went over the cliff edge, officials said.

I'm calling it a crime," Mendocino County sheriff tells HLN.April 5The Mendocino County Sheriff's Office clarifies that Jennifer and Sarah Hart were not wearing seat belts, contrary to previously reported information.The search for Devonte, Hannah and Sierra Hart is suspended due to heavy rain expected for the next few days, and authorities announce the three are believed to have also been in the SUV at the time of the crash."Information obtained through interviews with family and friends indicated it was rare for the family to be apart, especially while traveling," a news release from the sheriff's office says. "That information coupled with the other children being recovered outside of the vehicle ... supports the possibility that the missing children were swept away from the crash scene by the Pacific Ocean."
