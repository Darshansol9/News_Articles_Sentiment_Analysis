It also gives $1,250 raises for support staff and adds $50 million in education funding.OEA president Alicia Priest called it a "good starting point," but not enough. She said some classrooms don't have enough textbooks, and that some books are more than 20 years old -- affecting the quality of education for students.Priest said the $50 million increase approved by the state last week "will buy less than one textbook per student in Oklahoma.""We've been cut over 28% in the last 10 years in education funding, and our schools just can't maintain all of the supplies, instructional materials, textbooks, even copy paper," she said.
