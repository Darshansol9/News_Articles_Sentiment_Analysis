Marcus Watson, acting special agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said the father of Waffle House shooting suspect Travis Reinking could face charges for giving his son weapons after his firearms' privileges had been revoked.“It is possible if you transfer weapons knowingly to a person that is prohibited. That could potentially be a violation of federal law,” Watson said in an afternoon press conference.Last summer, Reinking was arrested by the Secret Service for trespassing near the White House.Reinking said he wanted to meet with President Trump. He told a Secret Service officer at the northeast entrance that he was a "sovereign citizen" who had a "right to inspect the grounds," according to a Metropolitan Police Department incident report dated July 7, 2017.He was charged with unlawful entry, but the charges were dismissed after he completed community service. At the FBI's request, Reinking's Illinois firearms authorization was revoked, and four weapons -- including the AR-15 style rifle used in Sunday's shooting -- were seized.After the firearms seizure, Reinking was legally prohibited from possessing guns, Matthew Espenshade, an FBI agent located in Nashville, said Monday.
