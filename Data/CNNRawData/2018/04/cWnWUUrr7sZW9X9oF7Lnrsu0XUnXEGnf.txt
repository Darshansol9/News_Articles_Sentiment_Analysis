(CNN) Syracuse University has permanently expelled the Theta Tau fraternity after footage emerged earlier this week of its members participating in a racist and anti-Semitic skit, Chancellor Kent Syverud said in a video statement Saturday.Theta Tau leadership was informed of the university's decision earlier Saturday, Syverud said, noting the school had suspended the fraternity soon after being made aware of the footage, which he called "racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, ableist and sexist."Students on the Syracuse campus this week were outraged after The Daily Orange , an independent student newspaper, obtained and posted a video in which a fraternity member makes another one swear to hold onto hatred for African-Americans, Hispanics and Jews, using racial slurs for those groups.Later, another student, using a derogatory word for Jews, makes a veiled reference to gas chambers in Nazi Germany.An investigation into the members involved with the video is also progressing, Syverud said. "In the last 72 hours, our Department of Public Safety has interviewed 38 individuals, with more to be completed in the next few days."Read More
