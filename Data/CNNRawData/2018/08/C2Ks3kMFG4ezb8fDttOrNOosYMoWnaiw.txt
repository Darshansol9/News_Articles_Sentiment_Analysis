(CNN) In the days after the Hart family's SUV was discovered at the bottom of a California cliff, investigators visited their Washington state home and were surprised to find almost no evidence that six children, ranging in age from 12 to 19, lived in the house.There were no toys in the home and no personalized decorations in the kids' bedrooms, according to documents released by the Clark County Sheriff's Office."Upon entering the house, it was found to be extremely clean and organized," one detective wrote, "giving a perception of being very sterile.""There was very little to show the children had access to any toys or items of entertainment, save for some board games found in the downstairs family room."The Hart family first made headlines when their upside down SUV was discovered at the bottom of a 100-foot cliff in Mendocino County, California, on March 26.Investigators later determined that Jennifer Hart was legally intoxicated when she drove her wife and several of their six adopted children off the side of the cliff.The bodies of Jennifer, her wife Sarah, and three of the children were recovered soon after the crash.The Hart family home in Woodland, WashingtonThe body of Sierra, 12, was discovered in the surf a couple weeks later. Two of the children, 16-year-old Hannah and 15-year-old Devonte -- once the focus of media attention after a photo of him hugging a white police officer in Portland, Oregon, went viral -- have not been found.Authorities soon learned the adopted children had repeatedly accused their parents of abuse, according to reports from neighbors and a social worker.The kids specifically said their parents would withhold food from them as punishment, prompting repeated visits to neighbors to beg for food. The neighbors eventually decided the issue warranted a call to Child Protective Services.Family left behind toiletries, suitcasesWhen authorities showed up on the doorstep of the Hart family home in Woodland, they found a social worker's business card wedged in the front door, along with a paper from Clark County Animal Control that said some of their pets had been taken for safekeeping, according to the sheriff's office report, which details investigators' initial efforts to uncover information about the family in the days after their car was discovered in California.Investigators also found a refrigerator recently stocked with groceries, and fresh fruit in bowls adorning countertops.It appeared the family had made a hasty departure, leaving behind their toothbrushes in a cup in the bathroom, and their suitcases still stacked in the garage."It seemed that if the family was planning a trip," the detective said, "they would have packed some bags with clothing and other personal belongings."One detective said it was difficult to distinguish which bedrooms belonged to the children. Only the parents' room could be identified based on their clothing and the decor. But none of the others rooms "were personalized for the children or showed the supporting elements that children lived in the residence," according to the report.Frames hanging on the walls of the Hart family home didn't contain any family photos.The family was apparently in the process of renovating the home, and had stored some remodeling supplies in one of the bedrooms.Some picture frames hung on the wall, but they didn't contain family photos -- simply pieces of paper specifying the frames' measurement that were included when the frames were purchased. Otherwise, nothing seemed out of the ordinary.Investigators have been working under the belief that Jennifer Hart intentionally drove the car over the side of the cliff.A rocking chair sits in front of a television in the Hart family's home."I'm to the point where I no longer am calling this an accident," Mendocino County Sheriff Tom Allman told HLN earlier this year . "I'm calling it a crime."But Clark County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sgt. Brent Waddell told CNN affiliate KOIN earlier this week that the motive may never be known."It's very frustrating," Waddell said. "It's human nature -- we want to put a reason to things happening."Co-worker was told kids would eat from garbage canThe report also details interviews with Sarah Hart's co-workers, who told investigators that Sarah spoke openly about the financial and emotional pressures of having a large family. Sarah also told them the children had "food issues and would eat out of the garbage after being provided dinner," according to the incident report.One told authorities she received a text from Sarah around 3 a.m. on Saturday, March 24, informing her coworker she was sick and wouldn't be able to open the Kohl's department store where they worked later that morning.A room inside the Hart family home in Woodland, WashingtonPolice later said the family was in Newport, Oregon, around 8:15 that morning , and continued driving south until they reached Leggett, California, that evening.
