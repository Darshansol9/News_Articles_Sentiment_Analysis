Taos County, New Mexico (CNN) Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe walked out of a CNN interview after defending his decision not to search a squalid New Mexico compound for a missing boy, despite having the property owners' permission to comb it.The sheriff has been criticized by the owners of the property where the compound sits illegally. Jason and Tanya Badger believe a missing child, 3-year old Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, may have been alive on the compound when they say they alerted law enforcement months ago.The Badgers gave written consent for a search, but it was August 3 before authorities moved in, finding 11 malnourished children and five adults. The adults have been charged with child abuse. The body of a young child was discovered days later but has not yet been positively identified.This was the exchange that led to Hogrefe abruptly ending the Saturday interview declaring, "I think we're done."Hogrefe: Unfortunately, it takes time to build a proper case. Time will tell if we did build a proper case, but I can promise you this: Had we have gone on that property based on a consent from an owner that was not an occupant of that property, we would not have valid right to be there and therefore the fruits of the unlawful tree would have come into play and we would have lost anything we could have possibly been able to criminally charge.Read More
