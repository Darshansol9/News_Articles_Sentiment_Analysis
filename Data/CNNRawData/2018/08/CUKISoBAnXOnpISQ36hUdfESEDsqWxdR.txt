(CNN) Child abuse charges against three of five adults who lived at a New Mexico compound where a child was found dead were dismissed Wednesday, court documents show.The 11 counts of felony child abuse against Hujrah Wahhaj, Subhannah Wahhaj, and Lucas Morten were dismissed because a judge ruled they didn't have a preliminary hearing in the 10-day time frame required by New Mexico state law for defendants in custody, a state courts official told CNN.They were released from Taos County Adult Detention Center on Wednesday, according to reports from CNN affiliates. CNN has not yet confirmed their release with law enforcement and attorneys for the trio.Two other defendants, Jany Leveille and Siraj Wahhaj, also had 11 child abuse charges dropped but were arraigned on felony charges in connection with the death of 3-year-old Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj , said Siraj Wahhaj's attorney, Thomas Clark.They face one count each of intentional abuse of a child resulting in death and conspiracy to commit intentional abuse of a child resulting in death (child under 12). Not-guilty pleas were entered by the court on each defendant's behalf.Read More
