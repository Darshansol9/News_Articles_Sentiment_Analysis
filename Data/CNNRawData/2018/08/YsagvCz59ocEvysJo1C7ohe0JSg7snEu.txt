(CNN) The Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh has received about 50 new allegations of abuse in the week since a grand jury report was published about sexual abuse by priests, according to the Rev. Nicholas S. Vaskov, executive director of communications for the diocese.Of the claims processed so far, none involve active clergy, Vaskov tells CNN. He says all the allegations date prior to 1990 and as far back as the 1940s."This is consistent with our previous statement that 90 percent of the incidents of abuse in the Diocese of Pittsburgh occurred before 1990," Vaskov wrote in an email to CNN.The claims were reported to the diocese through a hotline established by the church and via email. The allegations are new and were made by people who had not previously contacted the diocese, says Vaskov.None of the new allegations have yet been turned over to prosecutors, according to the district attorney's office in Allegheny County.Read More
