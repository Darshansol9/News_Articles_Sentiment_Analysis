North KoreaWell, here's a sentence we'd never thought we'd write: President Trump plans to meet with Kim Jong Un. That shocking announcement -- delivered in the White House driveway by a South Korean official -- means Trump could be the first sitting American President to meet with the leader of North Korea.The meeting would happen by May , but we don't know exactly when or where. And Kim reportedly is willing to talk about denuclearization and pledged that his regime would suspend testing of his missiles and nukes.Getting North Korea to curb or even shut down its nuclear program would be a massive foreign policy victory for Trump , who maintains that only the sanctions his administration has pushed for (and his tough talk) can bring the North to the negotiating table. But the North has a history of making agreements and then backing away from them, so l ots of people are skeptical that all this will lead to anything substantive.What North Korea wants from the USWhat North Korea wants from the US 01:41What North Korea wants from the US2. TariffsBefore the North Korea meeting bombshell, the President followed through on his promise to impose tariffs on steel (25%) and aluminum (10%) imports. There are exemptions for Mexico and Canada (as the NAFTA talks continue), and other US allies can petition to get exemptions of their own.The move's set up a weird political realignment. Most of Trump's GOP allies hate the idea and fear it'll set off a trade war that'll wreck the economy. Jeff Flake -- Arizona senator and Trump nemesis -- says he'll introduce a bill to stop the tariffs. But Democrats in districts in Pennsylvania and other steel-producing areas actually applauded Trump's action.Our allies are miffed about it , though. China called the tariffs "a serious attack," while South Korea called them "unjust." Meanwhile, just hours before the tariff announcement, several US allies signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership , the sweeping trade deal that Trump pulled the US out of right after taking office.JUST WATCHED Trump's awkward moment with a steelworker Replay More Videos ...

State lawmakers passed a bill that would bar women from getting abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy . Republican Gov. Phil Bryant says he'll sign it next week. Women who violate the measure would face criminal charges. Doctors who violate it could lose their medical licenses and face civil penalties. Some abortion rights groups are already prepping lawsuits.JUST WATCHED Abortion laws around the globe Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Abortion laws around the globe 01:334. ColombiaA former Colombian rebel group leader won't be running for president of the country after all. Rodrigo Londo√±o, a former leader of FARC, has ended his presidential bid because of health issues. He had led Colombia's most powerful guerrilla force through negotiations with the government that resulted in a historic peace deal. Colombia and FARC's agreement in 2016 ended a 52-year civil war that left more than 200,000 people dead.5.
