Either way, picking all 63 games (excluding the First Four games) correctly is next to impossible.The odds of picking a perfect bracket are less than one in 9.2 quintillion, according to DePaul mathematics professor Jeff Bergen.But if the odds scare you, here are some things that are much more likely to happen than picking a perfect bracket:Odds of making a half-court shot at a halftime competition: 1 in 50Read More
