(CNN) Eight Florida Highway Patrol troopers will report for duty Thursday at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, to secure entry points to the school, the site of a mass shooting last month that left 17 people dead.The deployment of the troopers came following Gov. Rick Scott's call Tuesday for extra security on the campus, after two students were charged earlier this week with bringing weapons to school and another was charged for making a threat on social media. Also likely playing a part in his announcement was the suspension of a Broward County Sheriff's Office deputy who was accused of "appearing to sleep on duty" in his patrol car while he was parked outside Stoneman Douglas this week.The governor asked Broward officials to require that an armed law enforcement officer guard every school entrance and said the highway patrol could help until a permanent plan is enacted, according to a letter Scott wrote to Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel and Superintendent Robert Runcie."We must work together to ensure that no family will have to endure the loss of a child because of a school shooting in Florida," the governor wrote.Runcie said he spoke to the governor about the matter before the letter was issued, and thanked him for the additional support.Read More
