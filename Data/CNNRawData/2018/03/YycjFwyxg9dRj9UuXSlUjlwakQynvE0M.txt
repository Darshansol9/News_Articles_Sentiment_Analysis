(CNN) A video from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on the afternoon of the Valentine's Day massacre shows former school resource officer Scot Peterson responding to the shots fired, but it doesn't provide much in the way of detail.Media organizations, including CNN, sued the Broward County Sheriff's Office to obtain surveillance footage at the Parkland, Florida, high school where 17 people were shot and killed by a former student in hopes of providing answers about the police response.But the edited 27-minute video that was released Thursday illuminates little.It begins with Peterson, wearing his deputy's uniform, standing between two buildings on campus talking to another adult, then appearing to speak into a radio handset on his shoulder. He walks off screen, and the video changes to a long angle of a golf cart driving away. Another angle shows the golf cart moving down a corridor before the shot switches again.The final shot, which lasts about 26 minutes, shows what police say is Peterson positioned outside a building. Students, whose images are pixelated, walk into the frame and then out of it.
