(CNN) A group of Howard University students say they've taken control of the school's administration building and won't leave until their demands -- including the resignation of the university president -- are met. They are protesting after university workers were accused of "double-dipping" on financial aid.The protesters -- more than 350 of them, leaders said -- had nearly the entire building on the Washington, DC campus to themselves Friday evening, save for some campus police officers and maintenance staff, demonstrators Juan Demetrixx and Alexis McKenney told reporters.Students met with two members of the University's Board of Trustees on Friday evening. During a press conference, McKenney said that students wanted to start negotiations, but accused the board members of not actually reading the students' demands."We now put this call out to the Board of Trustees to actually read our demands. That all alumni, students, facility, community members read the demands of Howard students and why we are actually here," said McKenney.In the words of Frederick Douglass, "power concedes nothing without a demand." These are our demands. #StudentPowerHU pic.twitter.com/pnFOefF2KM â€” #StudentPowerHU (@HUResist) March 26, 2018"We are trying to transform this institution.

"We should have a say in the direction and orientation of our university."Read More
