"We have a beautiful Capitol grounds, but we did not have a monument that actually honored the historical moral foundation of law."But not everyone was pleased about the monument."I'm appalled that they've actually gone through with it," LeeWood Thomas of the Arkansas Society of Freethinkers told CNN affiliate KARK-TV. "To see elected government officials go through with the erection of a religious monument on our Capitol lawn is appalling."The Ten Commandments Monument Display Act cites a 2005 Supreme Court decision from Texas that Ten Commandments monuments on state grounds were not a violation of the First Amendment.Powell told CNN on Tuesday the secretary of state's office set up a hotline for comments on the display, with 142 for the monument and 65 against it.
