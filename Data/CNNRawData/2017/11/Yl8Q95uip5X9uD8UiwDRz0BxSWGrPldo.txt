I want to prevent terrorists and drugs from coming into the country,'" Jose Martinez told the paper.Attack?Law enforcement has not explained the exact cause of Martinez's injuries.Even so, President Donald Trump cited the incident as a reason why the US needs to build a wall along the border with Mexico"As you heard, we lost a Border Patrol officer just yesterday and another one was brutally beaten and badly, badly hurt," Trump said Monday.

His partner arrived minutes later to find Martinez unconscious -- apparently after being struck multiple times, possibly with a rock, according to Cabrera. Responding agents found both officers incapacitated."It was a brutal attack," said Cabrera, speculating. "This was something well thought out and planned. They executed their plan."Cabrera said the surviving Border Patrol agent is having trouble remembering the incident.On Monday, Abbott's office announced a reward of up to $20,000 through Texas Crime Stoppers for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever killed Martinez and wounded his partner.He tweeted: "I'm offering a reward to help solve this murder of a Border Patrol Agent in Texas. Help us catch this killer."The FBI added another $25,000 to the reward pot on Tuesday.Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said the attack was "a stark reminder of the ongoing threat that an unsecure border poses to the safety of our communities and those charged with defending them."Mexico expressed its regret regarding the incident, its willingness to collaborate with the US Department of Homeland Security and condolences to the families of the two agents.
