Story highlights California's chief justice criticizes ICE for arresting undocumented immigrants at courtICE says courthouses are not considered sensitive locations for enforcement actions(CNN) California's chief justice is "deeply concerned" after reports that "immigration agents appear to be stalking undocumented immigrants in our courthouses to make arrests."The matter is the latest example of competing federal and local interests as concerns about immigration crackdowns under President Donald Trump continue to mount.The chief justice of California's Supreme Court, Tani Gorre Cantil-Sakauye , requested that federal agents stop conducting actions in the state's courthouses."Courthouses should not be used as bait in the necessary enforcement of our country's immigration laws," she wrote Thursday to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly."Enforcement policies that include stalking courthouses and arresting undocumented immigrants, the vast majority of whom pose no risk to public safety, are neither safe nor fair," she added.
