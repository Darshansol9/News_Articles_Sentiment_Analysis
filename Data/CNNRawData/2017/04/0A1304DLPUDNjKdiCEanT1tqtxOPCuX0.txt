Fifteen-year-old Elizabeth Thomas begins freshman year, during which she will take a forensics class with Cummins.January 23Elizabeth Thomas denied a student's allegation that she had kissed a teacher earlier this year.According to an internal school investigation report, "Student 1" says she walks into Cummins' classroom to retrieve her bookbag and witnesses Cummins kissing Elizabeth."It wasn't like a make-out kiss, just a peck on the lips," the middle school student says when she reports it to the administration.Uncomfortable, she leaves the room and finds "Student 3," a high schooler, to whom she relays what she just saw. The high schooler will later describe Student 1 as "freaked out" by the incident, according to the report.January 24"Student 1" wants to confront Cummins, 50, so she brings "Student 2," another middle schooler, to his classroom, the report says."Mr. Cummins commented to both Student 1 and Student 2 that he is a father figure to Beth.

He also revealed ... that Beth had been through a lot and had suffered an abusive home life," according to the report.Not satisfied, "Student 1" decides to go to the administration, the report says.January 25The school district begins an investigation. Over several days, Elizabeth, Cummins and an unidentified teacher are interviewed, according to the investigative report.Elizabeth says she goes to Cummins' classroom when she is upset or anxious. She considers him a friend and he knows how to calm her down. Other students feel the same about him, she says. She denies that they've ever kissed and says that she has been to church with him and his wife. The only time Cummins touches her, she says, is when he gives her the occasional fist bump. One time, he grabbed her hands to calm her down, she says.NEW PICTURES: Various shots of Ted Cummins in the past few weeks, including the vehicle he's believed to be driving.

He calls Elizabeth "a really good friend" and concurs that they've been to church together and that she comes to him when she needs someone to calm her down."He loves his wife and has never cheated on his wife and would never do anything to jeopardize his marriage," he says, according to the report."Teacher 1" tells school investigators that she sees Elizabeth in Cummins' classroom "a lot," during the day and before and after school. The door is always open, and no inappropriate behavior was ever witnessed, the teacher says. The teacher says, however, that Elizabeth recently moved her desk near Cummins' desk, and the teacher shares the sentiment that "Cummins should have a better boundary between his role as the student's teacher and the student's friend."January 27Elizabeth is removed from Cummins' class, according to the school district.January 30The kissing allegation can't be confirmed, the investigation concludes. Still, investigators recommend several actions, including removing Elizabeth from Cummins' class; instructing Elizabeth to present any anxiety issues to a guidance counselor; monitoring Cummins' class to ensure students are not there when they aren't supposed to be; and reprimanding Cummins "in regards to his duty to uphold his professional responsibility and behavior as a teacher to all students."January 31JUST WATCHED Ex-teacher sought for alleged kidnapping Replay More Videos ...

The district hands over its investigative materials.A Maury County Sheriff's Department detective contacts Elizabeth's father, Anthony Thomas, and informs him of the investigation, not knowing Thomas was unaware of the kissing allegation, according to a letter from Thomas' attorney, Jason Whatley, to schools Superintendent Chris Marczak. Thomas calls Love, "but was unable to get an answer of any kind," the letter states.February 1Thomas contacts a woman in Marczak's office who expresses concern Thomas "had been left in the dark" and says she feels Love should have informed him, according to Whatley's letter.

Elizabeth told her father, according to the letter, that she continues to take a class with Cummins. The teen's cell phone history indicates as well that she remains in contact with Cummins, the letter says."To make matters worse, it appears that this issue is being readily discussed by faculty members and, on at least one recent occasion, in a derogatory tone and manner about Mr. Thomas' daughter," the letter says.Whatley demands a meeting with Marczak, as well as an update on the investigation, an explanation of the measures taken to keep Elizabeth and Cummins apart, a copy of Cummins' personnel file and an order to faculty and staff that they stop discussing the matter within earshot of students.Cummins receives a letter from Marczak informing him he has been suspended without pay, "pending an investigation."February 8Amanda Hargrove, the school district's chief of staff, sends a memo -- to whom is unclear -- saying that Whatley's assertion that Elizabeth remains in Cummins' class is false.The memo also notes Cummins has been suspended and that Love will tell faculty and staff not to discuss the matter in front of students.

The low number of tips and Cummins' "limited resources" lead investigators to believe he may be keeping Elizabeth out of public view."He potentially may have them sleeping in the vehicle or Cummins may have driven them far away from Tennessee to a rural community.
