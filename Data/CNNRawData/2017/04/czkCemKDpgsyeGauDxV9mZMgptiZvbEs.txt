ChinaChinese President Xi Jinping will swing by the Mar-a-Lago resort this week to visit with President Trump. So just what will the two leaders talk about over those rounds of golf? North Korea is a good guess, especially after Trump's interview this weekend in the Financial Times. The President said the US would go it alone to stop North Korea's nuclear weapons program if the Chinese don't step in. They'll probably discuss trade too, since Trump torched China about the country's supposed trade inequities during his campaign.2. Supreme Court nominationThis is the week to put up or shut up. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch's confirmation vote is planned for Friday. Senate Democrats say they've got enough votes to filibuster his nomination. Senate Republicans swear Gorsuch will be confirmed. It will probably all hinge on whether the GOP decides to use the so-called nuclear option . Under that scenario, the Senate would change the rules and Gorsuch could be confirmed with a simple majority, or at least 51 votes, instead of the 60 votes needed to overcome a Democratic filibuster (for reference, the GOP has a 52-48 majority in the chamber).JUST WATCHED The man who could replace Justice Scalia Replay More Videos ...

More than 200 people are dead and over 100 are missing after mudslides wiped out entire communities over the weekend. Three rivers swelled and overflowed after torrential rains Friday night, pushing mud through the rugged, remote area and forcing people to run for their lives. Homes, bridges and highways were flattened. Many of the dead and missing are children.4. Ecuador electionsOne candidate declared himself the winner in Ecuador's presidential election, but sometimes things aren't that simple . Leftist and ruling party candidate Lenin Moreno says he won the national vote, but his opponent, conservative opposition candidate Guillermo Lasso, said things are too close to call, so he wants a recount. Moreno and Lasso are within three percentage points of each other with more than 96% of the vote counted. A recount will take weeks. Meanwhile, people took to the streets to protest the muddled outcome.5. Oklahoma police shootingBREAKFAST BROWSEPeople are talking about these. Read up.
