It will make identifying bodies easier."Texas is about to have a very significant disaster," said Brock Long, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.Gov. Greg Abbott warned of record-setting flooding and called on people to flee the area before the storm hits."My top goal is to be able to make it through this storm in a way in which we lose no lives," Abbott said. "Put your life first and your property second."The golden arches atop a McDonald's in Galveston were downed by high winds.Residents were urged to evacuate. A mass exodus from the coast caused extensive traffic jams along the state's highways, while other people boarded up windows and stocked up on food and water ahead of the storm, the effects of which are expected to last for days.The storm will stall and dump rain on South Texas and parts of Louisiana into the middle of next week, forecasters predicted.Latest developments-- Rockport, Texas, officials are advising residents who refuse to evacuate to write their names and Social Security number on a forearm, Mayor Pro Tem Patrick Rios told CNN. Rios said it will "help out first responders should they find a body."-- The National Weather Service in Corpus Christi issued an extreme wind warning for portions of the Texas coast. "Widespread destructive winds of 115 to 145 mph will produce swaths of tornado-like damage," the agency said.-- Texas' governor requested additional federal help with a presidential disaster declaration. The White House is considering the declaration.-- President Donald Trump, who will visit the area next week, has signed a disaster declaration for the state.I encourage everyone in the path of #HurricaneHarvey to heed the advice & orders of their local and state officials. https://t.co/N6uEWCZUrv — Donald J.

"If they refuse to heed the warning, that's on them."Long said he is "very worried" about storm surge, or "wind-driven water," slamming coastal areas, saying it has the "highest potential to kill the most amount of people and cause the most amount of damage."Trump tweeted that he has spoken with the governors of Texas and Louisiana, saying he is "closely monitoring Hurricane Harvey developments and here to assist as needed."Record flooding expectedChristopher Beafneaux, left, Ernesto Villarreal, center, and Roman Lopez board up windows of a business in Galveston.Officials worried that Harvey's deluge of rain will drench Texas and the region for several days."We could see this storm park for almost five days in some places, and we hear three feet of rain," said Bill Read, the former director of the National Hurricane Center. "That's just going to be a huge problem for these areas.""The water is going to be the issue," Corpus Christi Mayor Joe McComb said. "We've never had anything like this."Harvey is also causing concern in New Orleans, where heavy rain could usher in as much as 20 inches of rain through early next week and overwhelm the city's already-compromised drainage systemStorm nears shoreJoey Walker, 25, works with the Galveston Island Beach Patrol and is riding out the storm from a house on Galveston Island.

Hopefully it doesn't do any damage but if it does we've prepared. #HurricaneHarvey #WeatherChannel #CorpusChristi #hurricane #gulfcoast A post shared by Brittany Fowler (@bafowler1) on Aug 24, 2017 at 1:56pm PDTDespite the warnings, Elsie and David Reichenbacher prepped supplies and planned to stay put in Corpus Christi."I've gone through a lot of hurricanes. I've lived here most of my life," Elsie Reichenbacher said. "I'd rather take care of my home and my animals and be safe here. I'm on high ground with my house."
