What do we have to think about this? When we see those clownish figures in their Nazi uniforms pretending to be human, pretending to be something more than they are, pretending to be important. It's important to remember what that represents."Where, Shrage asked, "is the Franklini Roosevelt who led our country against Nazism. Where is our president. Where is the condemnation of evil?""Our children's and grandchildren's futures will be compromised if we do not stand up and condemn evil!" @BarryShrage @CJPBoston pic.twitter.com/iOjUdkAqw3 â€” Boston JCRC (@BostonJCRC) August 15, 2017Read More
