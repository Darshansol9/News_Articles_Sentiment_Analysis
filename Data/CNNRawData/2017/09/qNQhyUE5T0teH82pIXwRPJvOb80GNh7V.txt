At 5-foot-11, he was considered too small to play linebacker at a Division I school, but he proved his detractors wrong.While racking up a bevy of awards for academics, his prowess on the gridiron also earned him accolades. He played four seasons, helping lead his undefeated Sun Devils to the Rose Bowl his junior year.

In 2000, he tallied more than 140 tackles along with a handful of turnovers and quarterback sacks.After the 2001 season, which coincided with the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, Tillman turned down an offer from the Cardinals that would've paid him about $1.2 million year.
