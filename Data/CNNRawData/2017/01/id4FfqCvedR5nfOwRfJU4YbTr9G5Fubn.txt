The rapid timing of the order left scores of people from those seven countries stranded in legal limbo at US airports."This Land Is Your Land" was originally recorded in 1944 and was written as a retort to "God Bless America," which irritated Guthrie, according to NPRProtesters in Philadelphia also chanted "no hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here."Police shut down two lanes of traffic to accommodate the crowd while passing vehicles honked in support.
