(CNN) Donald Trump the businessman was no stranger to lawsuits, both frivolous and substantive.The high-profile wheeler and dealer filed numerous lawsuits and faced an array of allegations of his own before stepping into the Oval Office, including claims of sexual harassment, bilking investors and defrauding students of his eponymous university.Donald Trump the president has continued that legal legacy, as it were.Trump and his representatives have repeatedly defended the travel ban and dismissed concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Earlier this month Trump said he would transfer his business holdings to a trust run by his sons.As of midday Tuesday, Trump has been named in 42 federal lawsuits since his inauguration. By comparison, former President Barack Obama was named in 11 suits during his first 11 days in office -- some of them involving the long-debunked "birther" claims that Obama was not an American citizen.Here's a look at some of the lawsuits from the opening days of Trump's presidency.Darweesh v.

It targets Trump, Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, the State Department and the Director of National Intelligence.The White House has repeatedly said its travel ban is not based on religion and Trump has chastised the media for reporting otherwise. But CAIR alleges that the "underlying motive" of Trump's executive order is to ban people of the Islamic faith from entering the country."There is no evidence that refugees -- the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation -- are a threat to national security," Lena Masri, CAIR's national litigation director, said in a statement. "This is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality."Suit for those who never left for USJUST WATCHED Arab-American business owners: We create jobs Replay More Videos ...

The suit also was filed on behalf of people in similar situations."Plaintiffs file this present suit due to the fact that the existing orders do not encompass green card holders that were not en route or detained by the United States," the lawsuit says.Another case in VirginiaJUST WATCHED Schumer: Sessions must comment on travel ban Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH Ethics lawsuit filed against Donald Trump 02:36Just three days after Trump took office, the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington sued the President, alleging that Trump violated the Emoluments Clause of the ConstitutionCREW alleges in the suit filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York that the clause prohibits Trump from accepting anything of value from foreign governments, via his myriad business ventures overseas.Experts differ on whether the case is a viable one, and Trump lawyer Sheri Dillon said earlier this month that the Constitution's framers never considered "that paying your hotel bill was an emolument."Also, the US Supreme Court has has ruled that to sue in federal court, plaintiffs must prove a concrete and particularized injury. CREW has said that Trump is forcing it to "divert essential and limited sources" from its government watchdog role, forcing the organization to litigate the matter and educate the public unless a court stops him.In a column for The New York Times this week , Norman Eisen and Richard Painter -- former White House ethics lawyers who now serve, respectively, as CREW's chairman and vice chairman -- linked the emoluments case to the travel ban. The seven countries affected by the travel ban are areas where the President has done business in his previous life, they said.But he omitted Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Turkey, India and the Philippines -- countries Eisen and Painter contend have and do pose terror threats to the US.San Francisco sanctuary cityJUST WATCHED Mayors fight Trump's sanctuary city order Replay More Videos ...

The White House has threatened to withhold federal grants from any "jurisdictions" that protect undocumented immigrants and decline to prosecute them for violating immigration laws."The president's executive order is not only unconstitutional, it's un-American," Herrera said in a statement. "That is why we must stand up and oppose it. We are a nation of immigrants and a land of laws. We must be the 'guardians of our democracy' that President Obama urged us all to be in his farewell address.""Sanctuary cities have less crime, fewer people in poverty and lower unemployment than other counties," he said, citing a University of California, San Diego study . Herrera accuses Trump of exceeding his authority, and his lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of the presidential order and requests a finding that San Francisco is complying with federal law.TexasJUST WATCHED White House defends travel ban Replay More Videos ...

He was granted the visa, which required that the United States confirm he poses no security threat to the country, the lawsuit states.Issa left Iraq, flying from Baghdad to Qatar, with plans of then traveling to the United States. In Qatar, however, he was told he would be sent back to Iraq due to Trump's travel ban, the lawsuit states. Later, Issa was told he could enter the United States after all, the lawsuit states.On January 30, Issa arrived at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and was held by customs officials for 14 hours before an attorney could request an emergency hearing to have him released, according to the lawsuit.
