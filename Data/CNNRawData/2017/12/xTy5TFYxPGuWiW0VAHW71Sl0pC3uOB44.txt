Story highlights A US judge denied his asylum requestGutierrez says he fled Mexico because of death threats(CNN) A Mexican journalist who fled to the United States more than nine years ago because of death threats is now facing the possibility of deportation because his request for asylum was denied. Several prominent press freedom groups are coming to his defense."We live in fear and I'm afraid of being returned to Mexico and putting my son back in danger," Emilio Gutierrez Soto told CNN over the phone from a west Texas detention center.Gutierrez and his son, now 24, came to the United States in June 2008, according to his attorney, Eduardo Beckett. After reporting on corruption in Mexico's military, Gutierrez said he learned he had a price on his head, so he was forced into hiding. To save himself and his son, he said, he made his way to the United States.They entered the United States at a border crossing near Columbus, New Mexico, and sought political asylum, according to Beckett. As part of procedure, the father and son were immediately taken into custody and detained as asylum proceedings began. After seven months they were released, and both father and son were issued temporary work permits.Gutierrez and his son settled into life in nearby Las Cruces, New Mexico. The two worked in the restaurant industry and at one point they earned a living operating a food truck. They regularly checked in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials as required, his attorney said, and continued the asylum process.Read More
