On Monday, the 20-year-old had unintentionally outed her bisexual orientation to her religious parents.On Monday night, Smith's phone lit up with a text from her dad. He had seen a Facebook comment by Smith saying she "plays for both teams."

The page serves as a connection tool between students at Snow College in Ephraim, Utah, where Smith is a student.In her reply to whether she liked girls, Smith encouraged the inquiring person to "go ahead and message" her.
