When they arrived about four minutes later, they found several employees shot.People gather across the street from the scene of a shooting at a business park in the Edgewood area on Wednesday.Three victims Bayarsaikhan Tudev, 53, of Virginia; Jose Hidalgo Romero, 34 of Aberdeen, Maryland; and Enis Mrvoljak, 48, of Dundalk, Maryland were killed.Two others were injured and remained hospitalized in critical condition Wednesday night, officials said.Prince shot the five victims with a handgun and acted alone, officials said. It was unclear why he did it."Unfortunately, like most suburban counties in America, we are not immune to workplace violence," Harford County Executive Barry Glassman said after the shooting.10:46 a.m.: A second shootingPrince fled after the shooting, prompting a massive manhunt.He drove about 55 miles away to a car dealership in Wilmington, Delaware. At 10:46 a.m., he opened fire on a man who knew him.The victim was shot several times and took a gunshot to the head, police said.Despite his injuries, the man was conscious when officers arrived and he gave them Prince's name and a description of his vehicle, Wilmington Police Chief Robert Tracy said.Police, who had received an earlier alert about Prince from Maryland officials, spotted the vehicle leaving the scene and briefly chased it, before losing it."This individual knew the people he wanted to go shoot," Tracy said earlier of the six victims. "This wasn't a random act of violence where the person went out indiscriminately and was shooting people up."A picture of Radee Labeeb Prince, who police said is believed to have shot five people Wednesday, is shown to reporters at a news conference.The police chief said Prince and the Wilmington victim have "had beefs, and they've had history together," but did not elaborate.Prince has a lengthy criminal history, including 42 arrests, mostly for probation violations, and 15 felony convictions, Tracy said.5:35 p.m.: A key tipThe search for the suspect quickly intensified.Prince's photo was put up on FBI billboards along Interstate 95 from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C. and over Atlantic City, CNN affiliate WBAL reported.Schools in both Maryland and Delaware were locked down and photos of him and of his vehicle -- a 2008 black GMC Acadia SUV -- emerged on social media.Alert on I-95N warning drivers of search for Radee Prince in Black GMC Acadia.
