Story highlights Three killings within 11 days has a Tampa, Florida neighborhood on edgePolice say they have very few clues in their investigation so far(CNN) Police are swarming a Tampa neighborhood where three separate people were killed in the past two weeks, but authorities remain baffled amid fears that a serial killer is on the prowl.Days into an investigation, Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn said officials don't have many leads on who is responsible for three fatal shootings that are believed to be linked . Nor do authorities have a motive for the seemingly random acts, he said."This is an unusual case," Buckhorn said Tuesday. "There is no rhyme or reason other (than) folks being in the wrong place at the wrong time in the wrong neighborhood."The killings in the city's Seminole Heights neighborhood began on October 9, when 22-year-old Benjamin Mitchell was shot and killed in front of his home. The second victim, Monica Hoffa, 32, was killed October 11. Her body was found two days afterward by a city employee in a vacant parking lot half a mile from where Mitchell died.Then last Thursday, Anthony Naiboa, an autistic 20-year-old who had just graduated from high school, became the third victim after he accidentally got on the wrong bus after leaving work and ended up in the southeast Tampa neighborhood by mistake, police said. Authorities believe he was making his way to another bus stop but did not get more than 200 yards before he was shot and killed.(Left to right) Benjamin Mitchell, Anthony Naiboa and Monica Hoffa were each killed within 11 days in a Tampa, Florida neighborhood.Read More
