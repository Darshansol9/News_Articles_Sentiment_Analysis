President Donald Trump has proposed tying legislation strengthening background checks on firearm sales to immigration reform.In a tweet on Monday, Trump said: "We cannot let those killed in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, die in vain.""Republicans and Democrats must come together and get strong background checks, perhaps marrying this legislation with desperately needed immigration reform," Trump continued. "We must have something good, if not GREAT, come out of these two tragic events!"It wasn't immediately clear which specific pieces of legislation Trump was advocating in his messages.Trump is due to speak from the White House at 10 a.m. ET.
