(CNN) New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill says he won't resign despite pressure from the Police Benevolent Association union stemming partly from the firing of an officer involved in a 2014 fatal arrest."This is not something that you walk away from," he told press on Friday in response to questions about whether he planned to step down.Earlier this week, the PBA unanimously approved resolutions of no confidence in both O'Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio.The union's 27-member delegate assembly released the resolutions on Wednesday, calling for O'Neill's resignation and asking Gov. Andrew Cuomo to remove de Blasio from office.
