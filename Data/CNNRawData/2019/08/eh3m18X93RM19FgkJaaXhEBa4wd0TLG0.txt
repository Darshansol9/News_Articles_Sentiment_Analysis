"He was raised in a family that taught love, kindness, respect, and tolerance -- rejecting all forms of racism, prejudice, hatred, and violence. There will never be a moment for the rest of our lives when we will forget each and every victim of this senseless tragedy," the statement said.The statement also thanked the heroes who saved lives during the shooting.Mourning the victims in a display of Hispanic cultureJust a few blocks away from the Stanton Street Bridge -- a connector between El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juarez in Mexico -- a community came together Monday for a vigil that celebrated its culture, days after being brutally targeted by a white supremacistTwo Aztec dance groups performed prayers for the victims of the weekend shooting.

"I like the idea of using our culture -- that they're so threatened by -- to combat that, to fight their hatred with beauty."The groups led a vigil procession to @CarmelitaCasa's space at the foot of the Stanton Street Bridge, which leads to Ciudad Juarez. pic.twitter.com/fOJLe9cGmO — Eliott C. McLaughlin (@ByEliott) August 6, 2019Suspect's gun was legally purchasedThe suspect's weapon was purchased legally near his hometown in Allen, Texas, a suburb of Dallas, El Paso Police Chief Greg Allen said, describing the gun as a "7.62-caliber weapon."The suspected shooter, who court documents state has been unemployed for five months, has been cooperating with authorities since his arrest and "volunteered most of the evidence," Allen said.The man took about 11 hours to drive from his Allen home to the El Paso Walmart, Allen said.Crusius had no apparent ties to El Paso County, where 83% of residents are Hispanic or Latino, according to the US Census Bureau.When he arrived in El Paso, he first was "lost in a neighborhood," and then "found his way to the Walmart because, we understand, he was hungry," Allen said.Allen said he couldn't comment about whether Crusius had always intended to go the Walmart. When asked whether the suspect ate something from the store before the attack, Allen said: "That's what we suspect he did, right now."After walking into Walmart and spraying the center with bullets, Crusius got back in his car, drove to an intersection just north of the store, got out of the car and surrendered to an El Paso motorcycle officer who was helping establish a police perimeter around the business, El Paso police Sgt. Enrique Carrillo said.Crusius put his hands up and identified himself as the shooter, Carrillo said. The officer handcuffed the suspect on the spot.Crusius had a "stone cold look" when he surrendered, one police official who came face-to-face with him told CNN."It was a look I'd never seen before, and I've been on this force for 31 years," the official said. "I've seen murderers, robbers, nothing like this."Crusius has been charged with capital murder in the shooting and is being held without bond.He is a white supremacistAuthorities said they're investigating a racist, anti-immigrant document they believe the suspect posted about 20 minutes before the shooting.The four-page document, titled "The Inconvenient Truth," was published on the online messaging board 8chan and is filled with white supremacist language and racist hatred aimed at immigrants and Latinos. The author says he opposes "race mixing" and encourages immigrants to return to their home countries.The 2,300-word "manifesto," as police called it, was attached to a post that read: "I'm probably going to die today."Federal authorities said they're treating the shooting as a case of domestic terrorism, US Attorney for the Western District of Texas John Bash said, as it "appears to be designed to intimidate a civilian population, to say the least."The Justice Department is also "seriously considering" bringing federal hate crime and federal firearm charges, which carry a possible death penalty, he said.In the hate-filled document, the writer also says he held the beliefs he writes about before Donald Trump became president.Trump on Monday morning said the manifesto was "consumed with racist hate.""In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy," he said. "These sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America. Hatred warps the mind, ravages the heart and devours the soul."Trump is set to visit El Paso on Wednesday, a plan that was met with backlash from the El Paso County Democratic Party, which in an open letter asked him to cancel his trip."Since the start of your Administration, El Paso has been ground zero for many of the cruel immigration-related policies enacted by you in your efforts to punish, demonize and terrorize immigrants and immigrant communities," the letter, signed by El Paso County Democratic Party Chairwoman Iliana Holguin, read.Youngest victim was 15-year-old boyPolice identified the 22 victims on Monday.

You watch these things and see these things and you never think this is going to happen to your family," Elizabeth Terry, Jordan Anchondo's aunt, told CNN.Angie Englisbee, 86, was also killed. Her son told CNN she had gotten off the phone with his brother minutes before the first reports of an active shooter.A 60-year-old Army veteran and bus driver, Arturo Benavides, was also killed, his niece told CNN."He was an absolutely caring and strong-willed man," Jacklin Luna said. "He was the person that would give any dime and shirt off his back, a meal and a home to anyone."Leo Campos and Maribel Hernandez were also among those killed, according to CNN affiliate KFOX/KDBC.They had dropped off their dog at the groomer before heading to Walmart, Hernandez's brother, Al Hernandez, told the affiliate.
