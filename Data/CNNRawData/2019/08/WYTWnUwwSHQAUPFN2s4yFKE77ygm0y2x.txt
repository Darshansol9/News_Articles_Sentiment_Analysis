(CNN) A teenager from Ireland may have found a way to rescue our oceans from the growing plastic pollution problem.A walk on the beach led Fionn Ferreira to develop his project on microplastic extraction from water for the annual Google Science Fair. The project won the grand prize of $50,000 in educational funding at this year's event.The 18-year-old said that while he was out on that walk in his coastal hometown of Ballydehob, he ran across a stone with oil and plastic stuck to it -- something he says he's become more aware of in recent years."I was alarmed to find out how many microplastics enter our wastewater system and consequently the oceans," he wrote in his project . That's what got Ferreira thinking about how to develop a new extraction method.Fionn Ferreira presents his project to combat the ocean's plastic pollution problem at the Google Science Fair.The Google Science Fair has been crowning winners for eight years with the help of sponsors like Lego, Scientific American, National Geographic and Virgin Galactic.
