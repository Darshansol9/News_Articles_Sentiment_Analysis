(CNN) The video doorbell company Ring is working with more than 400 US police departments to streamline their access to user videos, the company announced on Wednesday.Ring, which is owned by Amazon, says the partnerships will allow police to post important safety information and view and comment on public posts to a Ring-operated portal. Police can submit requests for video recordings for certain locations to help with active investigations.But concerned privacy advocates say the partnerships threaten to create a 24/7 surveillance program."It is essentially a widespread CCTV network in which police and Amazon ... have access to cameras across the city on everybody's front doors," said Matthew Guariglia, a policy analyst for the Electronic Frontier Foundation , a nonprofit advocating for civil liberties in the digital world.As part of Ring's announcement, the company released an Active Law Enforcement Map that shows 405 police departments that use the Neighbors Portal, which is an extension of Ring's Neighbors app for police.Ring released a map of the more than 400 police departments that have forged partnerships with the company.
