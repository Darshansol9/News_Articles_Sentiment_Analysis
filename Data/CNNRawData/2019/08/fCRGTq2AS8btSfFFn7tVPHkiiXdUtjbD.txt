(CNN) A shipment of jalape√±os from Mexico to the US proved to be carrying more than just a spicy kick when Border Patrol agents found nearly 4 tons of marijuana hidden in the cargo.The discovery was made Thursday when a truck driver was flagged for a secondary inspection at the Otay Mesa border crossing in California.During the inspection, a K-9 team alerted officers to the peppers, according to a press release from US Customs and Border Protection. The federal agency didn't say why the driver, a 37-year-old male Mexican citizen, was initially flagged for a secondary inspection.Inside the pallets of peppers officers discovered over 300 green packages that field-tested for marijuana. Officials estimate the seized drugs are worth $2.3 million."I am proud of the officers for seizing this significant marijuana load," said Otay Mesa Port Director Rosa Hernandez in the press release.
