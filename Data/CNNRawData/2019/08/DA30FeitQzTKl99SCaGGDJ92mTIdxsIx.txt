(CNN) The family of the Dayton, Ohio, shooter published glowing obituaries of both the gunman and one of the first casualties in the massacre -- his younger sister, 22-year-old Megan Betts.The obituaries were published Tuesday on the website for the Conner & Koch Life Celebration Home in Bellbrook, Ohio, but the remembrance for gunman Connor Betts was removed Wednesday at the family's request, according to the funeral home.Connor Betts' parents later updated the message on their son's obituary page."Stephen and Moira Betts apologize that the wording of the obituary for their son Connor was insensitive in not acknowledging the terrible tragedy that he created," the message said. "In their grief, they presented the son that they knew which in no way reduces the horror of his last act. We are deeply sorry."The obituary for Betts, who was killed by police after he took nine lives in the August 4 mass shooting , was shorter than his sister's. Both writeups encouraged people to donate to an ecology institute in nearby Yellow Springs instead of sending flowers.
