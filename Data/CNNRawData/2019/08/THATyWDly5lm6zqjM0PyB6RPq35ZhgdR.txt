(CNN) A married couple wanted for murder escaped custody in southern Utah by faking a medical emergency, according to the US Marshals Service."We believe that they used some kind of a medical emergency or medical bathroom break for them to pull over to the side of the road," said David Gonzales, US Marshal for the district of Arizona. "And once they got over to the side of the road, they were able to overpower them, bind them and threw them in the back of the van they were in."Blane Barksdale, 56, and Susan Barksdale, 59 escaped custody Monday night as they were being transported from Henrietta, New York, to Pima County, Arizona. They were being extradited to face charges of arson, burglary and murder in connection with the death of Frank Bligh, a 72-year-old Vietnam veteran who was killed in April in Tucson, Arizona.Their escape set off a manhunt across the Southwest, and the US Marshals Service is offering a reward of up to $10,000 for each for information leading to their arrest.After the couple tied up the male and female guard in the back of the van, they drove to a remote area in northeast Arizona to meet with another person and get a new vehicle. The Barksdales then drove to an isolated area and left the van and the guards behind.Read More
