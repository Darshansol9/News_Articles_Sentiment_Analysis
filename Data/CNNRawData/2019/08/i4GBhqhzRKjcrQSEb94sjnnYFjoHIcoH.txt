Atlanta (CNN) The city of Atlanta will install markers next to Confederate monuments to give context to the painful history they represent.The first of the markers, funded by the Atlanta History Center, will be installed as early as Friday at the Peace Monument in Piedmont Park. A committee says it promotes the "Lost Cause" mythology, which portrays the Confederacy nobly by suggesting it was state's rights, not slavery, that prompted secession and the Civil War.The Peace Monument, for example, honors Confederate veterans while omitting the experiences of enslaved African Americans.The panels will give historical information about the time the monuments were built, said Sheffield Hale, president and CEO of the Atlanta History Center.A monument in Oakland Cemetery honors Confederate soldiers.Hale told CNN he hopes the markers will "provide additional information and a starting point for people to have a conversation about these monuments and what they're about, what they represent and don't represent, and to do it in a fact-based way."
