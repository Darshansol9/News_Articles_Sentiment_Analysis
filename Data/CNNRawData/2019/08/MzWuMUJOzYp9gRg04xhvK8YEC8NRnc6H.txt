(CNN) Rarely is something sweet born of something so bitter.The dispute over US Rep. Rashida Tlaib's canceled plans to visit her aging Palestinian grandmother has been rife with ugliness. But it has also sparked the #MyPalestinianSitty hashtag, wherein Twitizens have taken a break from cries of racism and anti-Semitism to remember the strength and resilience of their matriarchs.Sitty is a colloquialism for "grandmother" in Arabic.Tlaib and her congressional colleague, Rep. Ilhan Omar, had planned to visit Israel and the Palestinian territories this month, but the Israeli government banned them over their support for boycotting and divesting from the nation. The Michigan Democrat asked for an exception so she could visit her grandmother, said she would accept "any restrictions" Israel placed on her trip and would avoid promoting boycotts during the visit.Israel decided to grant Tlaib entry, but under a set of restrictions that the lawmaker later said amounted to an attempt to silence her."Visiting my grandmother under these oppressive conditions meant to humiliate me would break my grandmother's heart," she saidThe incident was fuel for both sides of the debate. Tlaib's supporters cited the move as evidence that Israel feared the world knowing the truth about its occupation of the Palestinian territories. The legislator's critics claimed she staged the entire exchange so she could continue bashing Israel.US President Donald Trump, who has stood at the center of the fray since he declared Israel would show "great weakness" if it admitted the congresswoman into the country, led the latter charge, tweeting that Israel had shown Tlaib respect by letting her visit her grandmother, only for Tlaib to grandstand once she received permission.Israel was very respectful & nice to Rep. Rashida Tlaib, allowing her permission to visit her "grandmother." As soon as she was granted permission, she grandstanded & loudly proclaimed she would not visit Israel. Could this possibly have been a setup? Israel acted appropriately! ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 16, 2019"Permission was quickly granted, whereupon Tlaib obnoxiously turned the approval down, a complete setup. The only real winner here is Tlaib's grandmother. She doesn't have to see her now!" Trump tweeted.The next day, the #MyPalestinianSitty hashtag emerged when Shatha Odeh came to Tlaib's defense, posting old photos of her grandmother.In honor of @RashidaTlaib amazing sitty, here is #MyPalestinianSitty standing next to my mother sometime in the 80s.

Others shared heartbreaking stories of women forced to leave their homes and dying before they'd have a chance to return."Illiterate, but memorized the Quran front-to-back. Married at 13, but made me promise to finish school before settling down. My heroine, my badass," tweeted Ahlam Chehabi.Illiterate, but memorized the Quran front-to-back.
