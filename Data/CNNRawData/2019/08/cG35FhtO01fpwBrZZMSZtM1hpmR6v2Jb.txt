(CNN) New York students may soon have to learn about swastikas and nooses as part of their curriculum.Democratic state Sen. Todd Kaminsky has introduced a measure that requires lessons on hate symbols to be part of the student curriculum in grades six through 12.Kaminsky said the measure is in response to the spike in hate crimes nationwide.He said there's "a general feeling that our young people don't understand the gravity of the hate crimes they perpetrate" despite learning about Jim Crow and the Holocaust in school. "Good government means putting the traffic light on the corner before the car crash," he said.Kaminsky anticipates broad support for the bill among his colleagues and said the teachers he's spoken to are "interested and excited" about it.
