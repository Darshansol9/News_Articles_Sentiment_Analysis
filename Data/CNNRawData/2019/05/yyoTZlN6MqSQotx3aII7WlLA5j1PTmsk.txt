(CNN) A bill that would ban Maine public schools, colleges and universities from using Native American mascots is one step closer to becoming law.The Maine Senate voted 23-10 on Tuesday to pass the measure, which would prohibit schools from "having or adopting a name, symbol or image that depicts or refers to a Native American tribe, individual, custom or tradition and that is used as a mascot, nickname, logo, letterhead or team name of the school."
