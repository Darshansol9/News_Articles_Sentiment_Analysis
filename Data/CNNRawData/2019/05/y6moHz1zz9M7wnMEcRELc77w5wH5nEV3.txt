(CNN) About 60 students stranded at a Texas elementary school overnight amid heavy rain and flooding are home as of Wednesday morning, a school official said.A downpour kept buses and parents off the roads in Cleveland, Texas, and forced Southside Elementary to keep students inside, Cleveland Independent School District spokeswoman Susan Ard told CNN."In Cleveland we have a lot of low-lying areas," Ard said. "We can't get buses through."More than 100 faculty and staff members remained at the school to sleep in shifts to keep watch on the students, Ard said.

School was not in session for the district Wednesday.Read More
