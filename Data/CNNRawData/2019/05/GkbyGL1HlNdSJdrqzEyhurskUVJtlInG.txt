14-year-old Lorenzo Clerkley says he was unarmed and given no time to respond to an Oklahoma City police officer's command before the officer shot him twice in March. Oklahoma police say Clerkley was holding a replica pistol that was recovered at the scene. The officer was placed on administrative leave and has since returned to active duty after being cleared of criminal wrongdoing.
