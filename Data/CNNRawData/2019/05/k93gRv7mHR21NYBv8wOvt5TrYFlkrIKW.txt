And it is.It takes roughly 45 minutes to an hour (or more) and is one of the most well known workouts in all of CrossFit.In 2014, 'The Murph Challenge ' became the official fundraiser of the Lt. Michael P. Murphy Memorial Scholarship Foundation. Since 2014, the organization started by Murphy's family has raised more than $1 million.Lt. Murphy was killed during a reconnaissance mission to find a key Taliban leader in Afghanistan.When the team came under fire from a much larger enemy force, Murphy knowingly left his position of cover to get a clear signal in order to communicate with his headquarters, the U.S. Navy said.
