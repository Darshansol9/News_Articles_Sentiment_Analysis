(CNN) A blood test conducted after a bartender at Tiger Woods restaurant left work and had a fatal crash in December shows the employee was drunk and had the active ingredient from marijuana in his blood when he died.The parents of Nicholas Immesberger are suing Woods and others, saying employees at The Woods Jupiter served their son far too much alcohol, knowing the bartender was an alcoholic.The toxicology report, released Wednesday, says Immesberger, 24, had a blood alcohol level of .256 and levels of THC well above the state reporting limits when his blood was drawn.Family attorney Spencer Kuvin said Tuesday that Florida law holds that when a business over-serves someone known to be addicted to alcohol, that business is responsible for what occurs.The wrongful death lawsuit targets Woods, who owns the restaurant where Immesberger worked, and Woods' girlfriend Erica Herman, who is listed in the complaint as the general manager of the business.
