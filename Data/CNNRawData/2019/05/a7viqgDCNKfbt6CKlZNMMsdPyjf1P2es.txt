(CNN) Monday marked a historic day in Chicago as the city inaugurated its first African-American lesbian mayor.Lori Lightfoot, a former assistant US attorney, was sworn in at Wintrust Arena in the Near South Side community."We are a proud city with a proud history," Lightfoot said. "In this moment, I can't help but look at all of you and think about what lies ahead and what we can be together."She said she would fight the city's gun violence problem, pledged job growth and promised to hold equity and inclusion as a guiding principle. Lightfoot said she would push for integrity in city government."Putting Chicago government and integrity in the same sentence sometimes may seem a little strange," she said. "But friends, that's going to change, because it's got to change. For years, they've said, 'Chicago ain't ready for reform.' Well, get ready because reform is here."
