(CNN) Two years ago, Sam Blakely aborted a pregnancy after she was raped.Now she has a message for Alabama state lawmakers and Gov. Kay Ivey after they passed the most restrictive abortion law in the country -- one that includes no exemptions for victims of incest or rape like herself."I have absolutely no words to describe the disgust that I feel and so many women have told me that they feel," Blakely told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on "New Day" Thursday morning."They're scared. They're angry," she said. "We don't know what's going to happen. We are seriously in fear for our lives as women in Alabama."Blakely said the moment she was discovered she was pregnant with her rapist's child was "the worst moment of my life."
