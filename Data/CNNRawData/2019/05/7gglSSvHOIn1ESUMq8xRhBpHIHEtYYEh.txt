A public advisory was issued this morning after approximately 142,600 gallons of combined sewage was discharged into Lake Erie during last night’s heavy rain event, according to the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District.The Sewer District’s Water Quality and Industrial Surveillance Department has posted signs at Edgewater Beach in Cleveland, advising beachgoers to avoid contact with the water.Jenn Elting, a sewer district spokesperson, said water quality will be tested daily.“We will continue to test water quality at the beach twice daily (normally it's each morning during beach season) until E. coli is at a safe level," Elting said in a statement. "Combined sewage isn’t the only cause of high bacteria at the beaches; rains will bring you non-point source pollution from stormwater runoff, wildlife at the beaches and wind/waves can kick up settled bacteria as well.”
