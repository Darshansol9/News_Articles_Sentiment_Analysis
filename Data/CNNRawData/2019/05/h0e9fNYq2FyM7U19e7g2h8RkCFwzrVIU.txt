(CNN) Several city blocks in Davenport, Iowa, remain flooded nearly a week after the swollen Mississippi River broke through a temporary barrier, sending water rushing into the city's downtown.And now more inclement weather is on the way in the days ahead.The flooding began last Tuesday when a temporary levee failed, sending water into Davenport buildings and flooding vehicles that had been left behind. Officials have said they are concerned that the flooding could weaken some buildings' foundations over time.The Mississippi River at Rock Island, by Davenport, reached a record crest of 22.70 feet last Friday and has since dropped to a crest of 21.1 feet, according to the National Weather Service . Anything above 18 feet is considered to be major flood stage.Davenport firefighters used a boat to ferry people from buildings surrounded by floodwaters on Tuesday.The height of the river is expected to go down over the coming days, despite the forecast of rain ahead. The Mississippi River initially reached that dangerous height due to a mix of rain and melting snow that caused all of the rivers in the system to crest at the same time.Read More
