(CNN) Owners of a replica of Noah's Ark are suing their insurers, saying the companies failed to adequately cover damage to the surrounding property caused by heavy rain.The ark itself -- a 510-foot wooden ship modeled after the biblical ark -- made it through the rain just fine, a representative for Ark Encounter in Williamstown, Kentucky, told CNN. But the rainfall in 2017 and 2018 caused a "significant landslide" on the property, which undermined an access road leading to the massive wooden vessel.As a result, the access road was unsafe to use and repairs cost approximately $1 million, according to court documents.The park filed suit this week in US District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, alleging its insurers acted in bad faith after investigating the property damage.The suit claims that representatives from five of the park's insurers told the owners to proceed with repairs but have since paid only "a very small portion" of the $1 million cost.Read More
