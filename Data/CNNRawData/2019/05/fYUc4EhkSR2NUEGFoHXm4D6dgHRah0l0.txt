"With only a few watching from cover, a Tomb Sentinel approached the Unknowns with (US) flags in hand," the Army's 3rd Infantry Regiment said in a Facebook post. "As thunder shook the ground and rains washed down without abandon, the Tomb Sentinel pierced through the elements with breath-taking precision."
