(CNN) Despite the mixed reaction to her call for a sex strike to protest restrictive abortion laws, Alyssa Milano says it has definitely helped raise awareness."My purpose for sending out that tweet was simply, I felt like these bills were being ignored and sending out that tweet, look at me now, I'm on your show and we're talking about women's rights and how they're being rolled back," she told CNN's Chris Cuomo Tuesday night.Three days after Georgia's governor signed the controversial "heartbeat bill" -- banning abortions if a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which can be as early as six weeks -- the actress went on Twitter to call for a sex strike until "we get bodily autonomy back."Many women were critical of the strike, saying that it assumed sex is enjoyed only by men and that women's bodies are commodities that can be denied to men as punishment. Some people also pointed out that the sex strike ignored LGBTQ people and didn't consider the possibility of sexual violence.Following the response, Milano later tweeted: "The #SexStrike tweet has reminded people of the Republican war against women... These oppressive, regressive, forced-pregnancy bills are now being discussed in a serious manner on our national news cycle."Read More
