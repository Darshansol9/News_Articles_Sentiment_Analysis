(CNN) The two teenage suspects in the deadly mass shooting at a Colorado charter school will appear in court next week to hear the charges against them.George Brauchler, district attorney for Douglas and other counties, has said 18-year-old Devon Erickson and 16-year-old Alec McKinney, both students at the school, will face murder, attempted murder and perhaps other charges."My heart goes out not just to the victims in this case, but there are those that won't be classified as victims that are feeling it ... right now. Moms and dads looking at each other making decisions about whether or not to send their kids to school in one of the greatest school districts in the country because they don't feel safe," Brauchler said Wednesday.The suspects' hearings initially were scheduled for Friday afternoon but have been moved to Wednesday morning, the district attorney's office said.Brauchler is considering charging McKinney as an adult, he said.
