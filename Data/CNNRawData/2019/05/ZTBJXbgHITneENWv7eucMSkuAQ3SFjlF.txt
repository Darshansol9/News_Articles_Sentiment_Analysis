It moved through the area Tuesday evening.Morgantown was one of the hardest-hit areas in the county, but no one was injured there, Caernarvon Township Police Chief John Scalia told CNN affiliate KYWHouses near Morgantown suffered heavy damage Tuesday evening."When you drive around, see the destruction, you realize how lucky we are nobody was hurt," Scalia said.Arkansas braces for record river levelsRains this week are exacerbating flooding that has troubled parts of the central US for weeks.JUST WATCHED Tornadoes threaten the Plains for the 13th straight day Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Tornadoes threaten the Plains for the 13th straight day 01:21While flooding has occurred for days along the Arkansas River in Oklahoma , the river is now approaching record levels to the east, in Arkansas itself.In western Arkansas near the communities of Van Buren and Fort Smith, the Arkansas River is expected to crest Wednesday afternoon at around 41 feet -- roughly 3 feet above the record there.Levees along the river in Arkansas have worked so far -- water has overtopped two of them, but they have not failed, Arkansas emergency management spokeswoman Melody Daniel said.Daniel said more than a dozen Arkansas counties are expected to see historic flooding.Here are our most updated forecasts for the Arkansas River from Tulsa, OK down to Pine Bluff, AR. #OKflood #ARFlood pic.twitter.com/MGxbdXqy0k — NWSABRFC (@NWSABRFC) May 28, 2019Officials in the central Arkansas city of North Little Rock, across the river from the state capital, believe 50 homes could soon be impacted by flooding, the city said in a Facebook post.One person was killed in Arkansas Tuesday evening after drowning in floodwaters, police told CNN.Intentional water release has been flooding homes outside TulsaIn western Oklahoma, the swollen Arkansas River has posed a threat to Tulsa's levees -- so the Army Corps of Engineers has intentionally been releasing water from a dam to the west in hopes that the levees aren't overwhelmed.Although that spilled water won't threaten Tulsa, it is contributing to the flooding of dozens of homes in a less populated area, just outside the city of Sand Springs.Some homes had 2 to 6 feet of water in them, residents told a CNN crew there.Rick Sawn's Sand Springs-area home still was dry on Wednesday morning, but water has been creeping toward it."I think it's a 500-year flood and so far our dam and levees are doing what they were designed to do," Sawn, 68, said. "There is flooding and some loss of property, and long-term recovery head of us, but without the dam system, it would have been far, far worse."The Army Corps of Engineers has been releasing about 275,000 cubic feet of water per second from the Keystone Dam, about 20 miles west of Tulsa -- which is the equivalent of three Olympic-sized pools. Doing so will increase the strain on some of Tulsa's levees, Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum said.This aerial image from Tuesday shows flooding near Sand Springs, Oklahoma.The Keystone reservoir has started dropping, and that could allow the Army Corps of Engineers to slow the rate of the water release by Friday, corps hydrologist David Williams said.Bynum has been asking Tulsa residents who live near the levees to relocate temporarily, just in case the levees don't hold."There is absolutely no need to wait until the last minute when an evacuation might be necessary," he said at a news conference.
