(CNN) The woman shot by a Baytown, Texas, policeman after telling the officer she was pregnant suffered from schizophrenia, attorney Ben Crump said Thursday.While Baytown police Lt. Steve Dorris has said Pamela Shantay Turner, 45, was not pregnant, Crump said her family has arranged a private autopsy to determine if that's true. The results of the exam will be available Friday, he said."This is a woman who is struggling with schizophrenia," the civil rights attorney said. "Her daughter just gave birth to her granddaughter. Maybe she's having a moment of channeling her daughter. We don't know. Maybe she is trying to protect herself and say things that will prevent this police officer from further battering her."Turner's funeral is scheduled for May 23. The Rev. Al Sharpton will deliver the eulogy, Crump said.Police have said that Officer Juan Delacruz was patrolling an apartment complex in the Houston suburb when he saw Turner, whom he knew had outstanding warrants. He tried to arrest her, police said.Read More
