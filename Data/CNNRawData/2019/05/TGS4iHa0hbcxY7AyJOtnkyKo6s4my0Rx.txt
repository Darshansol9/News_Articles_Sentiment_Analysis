(CNN) The ACLU of Texas has filed a claim seeking $100 million in damages for the family of a 20-year-old Guatemalan woman who was shot and killed by a US Border Patrol agent.The claim , filed Thursday by the ACLU and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP, alleges that neither Claudia Patricia Gomez Gonzalez nor the group she was traveling with posed any threat to the agent who shot her."The family wants to know what happened. The family wants to know who killed their daughter. And the family wants to know what the government is going to do to hold this agent accountable," Edgar Saldivar, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Texas, told CNN on Friday.US Customs and Border Protection declined to comment on the claim, citing its policy against commenting on pending litigation. The agency hasn't released the name of the agent involved in the shooting or details about the investigation into what occurred.Gomez was shot on May 23, 2018, in Rio Bravo, Texas, a small border town about 170 miles south of San Antonio. Her family told CNN last year that she'd headed to the United States to find work after being unable to find a job in Guatemala.
