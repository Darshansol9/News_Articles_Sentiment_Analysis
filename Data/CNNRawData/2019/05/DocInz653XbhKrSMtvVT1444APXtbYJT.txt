Bynum tweeted Wednesday that 215,000 cubic feet of water per second is the minimum rate they can release to keep the water in the reservoir from topping the floodgates. If the floodgates don't work, the dam could fail, Bynum said.While that dam is about 20 miles from the city, Tulsa authorities told people to be ready to leave their homes quickly if the situation deteriorates.They also warned residents to stay out of the swollen rivers and creeks."Please do not play or walk in the flood waters and make sure your children stay out of the water," a tweet on the city's verified account said. "This is dangerous for many reasons -- strong currents, possible sinkholes, and sewage. There are also several reports of snakes."Runaway barges smash into damOn Thursday, two barges that had broken free on the swollen Arkansas River drifted downstream and slammed into the Webbers Falls Lock & Dam, according to Kim Wann, the LeFlore County emergency manager.

The barges were briefly stationary after getting caught on a rock jetty Thursday morning but later broke away again.No breach in the dam has been identified, Wann said, and state officials and the Army Corps of Engineers are assessing the potential damage.Marlene Paul watches as the Arkansas River approaches her home in Webbers Falls, Oklahoma.Because of flooding along the Arkansas River and Bayou Manard, some people in and around the communities of Webbers Falls, Muskogee and Fort Gibson were being evacuated Wednesday, state emergency management spokeswoman Keli Cain said.Flooding risksStorms have repeatedly hit the same areas recently, making the Plains and the Midwest more vulnerable to flooding.Serious flooding -- including along the already swollen Mississippi River -- is expected as more rain falls over the region in the next few days.The high water levels and fast-moving currents led the US Coast Guard on Thursday afternoon to close a portion of the Mississippi River from mile marker 179 to 184 and institute a no wake order along the Illinois River from mile marker 10 to mile marker 80.2.A no wake order limits the speed of vessels. A vessel must move slowly enough so it doesn't produce a wake behind.Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify the name of the Missouri capital.
