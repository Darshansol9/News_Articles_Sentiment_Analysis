(CNN) Jenny Teeson accused her husband of drugging and raping her while she slept two years ago.The Minnesota woman found videos of the incident on her computer, according to the Star Tribune newspaper. However, when the couple went to court, Teeson's husband agreed to a plea deal, was convicted of invading her privacy and received only a 45-day jail sentence.That's because until Thursday, a statute in Minnesota law referenced "the voluntary relationship defense" for criminal sexual conduct crimes that essentially allowed for marital rape. The statute protected people from prosecution if the sexual misconduct they committed was against a partner in an "ongoing, voluntary relationship."Gov. Tim Walz made the repeal of the statute official Thursday during a signing ceremony.
