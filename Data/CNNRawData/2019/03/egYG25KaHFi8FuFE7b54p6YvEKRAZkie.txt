(CNN) The Boulder Police Department has launched an internal investigation after an encounter between a group of officers and a black man was captured on video and circulated online.The video, which was published on YouTube and on social media, was filmed on the morning of March 1 in Boulder, Colorado. It shows a man with a bucket and a long item in a front yard of a townhouse complex. An officer appears to be talking to the man and has his hand on his hip."He's picking up trash," the person filming says repeatedly, as the man and the officer exchange words at a distance. "He lives here," the person filming says. The officer is then joined by other officers and the man and the officers appear to be yelling at each other. The video ends with all the officers walking away.Three days later, the Boulder Police Department released a statement that recounted officers' version of events and announced an internal affairs investigation."A Boulder police officer observed a man sitting in a partially enclosed patio area directly behind a 'Private Property' sign and initiated contact with the man to determine if he was allowed to be on the property," the department said.Read More
