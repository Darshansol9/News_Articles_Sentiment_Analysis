(CNN) Emergency medical technician Alex McNabb has been let go by Jeb Stuart Rescue Squad months after racist comments surfaced on a podcast in which he compared black patients to gorillas and claimed to take "immense satisfaction" as he "terrorized" an African-American boy with a needle.Wren Williams, the attorney for the Patrick County, Virginia, rescue squad, sent a statement from the board saying, "During executive sessions, the pros and cons of Mr. McNabb's continued relationship with the squad were discussed, a legal opinion from outside legal counsel was shared among the board members, and the board members shared their personal thoughts."The board did not state exactly why it fired McNabb but it did so after discussions in an executive session on Sunday. The squad placed McNabb on unpaid leave in December, two days after news reports of his comments surfaced.McNabb has said it's his First Amendment right to say the things he has said and that it was all said while he was pretending to be a fictional character he created named Dr. Narcan.He has not responded to CNN's request for comment.Read More
