(CNN) The world's largest children's museum is removing three Michael Jackson artifacts from display, but it is keeping photos of the King of Pop in an exhibit honoring a young AIDS patient.The Children's Museum of Indianapolis says it is removing Jackson's fedora and white gloves, which it obtained in an auction, from its American Pop exhibit, and it's also pulling a signed poster from The Power of Children exhibit, spokeswoman Leslie Olsen said in a statement."We are very sensitive to our audience," she said. "In an excess of caution, and in response to the controversy over the HBO film called 'Leaving Neverland,' which directly involved allegations of abuse against children, we removed those objects while we carefully consider the situation more fully."It was not immediately clear if the artifacts could be put back on display after museum officials review the situation.
