(CNN) No charges will be filed against protesters in Sacramento, California, who were arrested during a Stephon Clark-related demonstration Monday, the district attorney's office said Friday.More than 80 people were taken into custody as they protested District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert's decision not to file charges against the police officers involved in the March 2018 fatal shooting of Clark.A statement from the her office said Schubert had reviewed police reports from the protest in East Sacramento where 84 people were arrested."In the interest of justice, no charges will be filed in any of the cases submitted," the statement said.At a news conference March 2, Schubert announced the officers would not be charged because an investigation found they had not broken any laws.
