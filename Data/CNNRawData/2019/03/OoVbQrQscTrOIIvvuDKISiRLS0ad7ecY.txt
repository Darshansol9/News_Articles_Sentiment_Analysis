(CNN) Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx now indicates uncertainty about the strength of evidence and testimony that underpinned charges against Jussie Smollett, and she welcomes an outside review of how her office handled the case, she wrote Friday in The Chicago Tribune.Foxx defended her office's decision to drop 16 felony charges against the "Empire" actor, who was accused of staging a hate crime attack on himself. In exchange, he agreed to forfeit his $10,000 bail and complete community service.Smollett, 36, has maintained that he has been "truthful and consistent" about the assault."There were specific aspects of the evidence and testimony presented to the office that would have made securing a conviction against Smollett uncertain," Foxx wrote. "In determining whether or not to pursue charges, prosecutors are required to balance the severity of the crime against the likelihood of securing a conviction."For a variety of reasons, including public statements made about the evidence in this case, my office believed the likelihood of securing a conviction was not certain," she wrote, without elaborating on what matters might have been problematic.
