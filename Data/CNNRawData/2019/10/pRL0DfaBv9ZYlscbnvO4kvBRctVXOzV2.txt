(CNN) A federal judge declared a mistrial Friday after a jury failed to reach a verdict on two charges filed against a former New Jersey police chief who uttered racial slurs after allegedly using excessive force on a handcuffed black man.Frank Nucera Jr., 62, who also called Donald Trump the " last hope for white people ," was found guilty in federal court earlier this week of lying to the FBI, but a jury failed to reach a verdict on counts of committing a hate crime and violating a man's civil rights through excessive force during the arrest, according to Matthew Reilly, spokesman for the US Attorney for the District of New Jersey.Frank Nucera Jr. was the police chief in Bordentown Township, New Jersey.After Nucera was convicted Wednesday of a count of making false statements to the FBI, the jury resumed deliberations on the additional charges, according to the federal prosecutor's office.But the jury was deadlocked on the two counts and Judge Robert Kugler declared a mistrial Friday. Reilly said Nucera will be retried on those counts. Sentencing on the guilty count is set for February 6 but the date is likely to change pending resolution of the other charges, Reilly said.Nucera's attorney, Rocco Cipparone, said, "I was hopeful that there would have been a not guilty verdict, because I do believe there is more than enough reasonable doubt, but at least it's a hung jury."Read More
