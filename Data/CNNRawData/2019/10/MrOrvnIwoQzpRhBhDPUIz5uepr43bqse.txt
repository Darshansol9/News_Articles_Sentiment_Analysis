Hugo Villanueva-Morales, 29, is on the run and should be considered "armed and dangerous," a Kansas City, Kansas Police Department news release said."We're still looking at all of our leads; we're receiving tips," Chief Michael York said in a Monday press conference. "Our federal partners are assisting us as well, so we hope to find him soon." The chief urged anyone who sees the suspect to "stay away" and not confront him.Javier Alatorre (left) was arrested Sunday in connection with the deadly bar shooting.

He said they didn't have any indication "he was going to come back to do what he did."Two hours later, the two suspects came into the bar with handguns and began shooting.'We thought it was a dream or a lie'Meza-Aguirre, one of the younger victims, was known to his friends as "Ever.""So far, we haven't comprehended what happened," his aunt, Guadalupe Escalante told WDAF. "We thought it was a dream or a lie."He was dancing inside the bar early Sunday morning with Celeste Trevino when the shooting began and he pushed her out of the way, she said."He saved me," Trevino said. "I just remember holding his face ... I'm pretty sure he still had my lipstick on his cheek when he died, because I remember kissing him on the cheek."Calderon, another victim, was Trevino's brother-in-law."He was a great dad. And a lot of people are going to miss him," Trevino said.Calderon's funeral will be held on Thursday morning at All Saints Catholic Church in Kansas City, Porter Funeral Home said.Anaya-Garcia, known to his friends as "Stranger," was at the Tequila KC bar with his fianc√©e and died in her arms, according to their friend, Shay Celedon. Celedon said she was with them at the bar but left two hours before the shooting."I go home, go to bed, get woken up two hours later (to learn) that he's deceased, and she held him 'til he took his last breath, and tried to bring him back and keep pressure on his gunshot wound. And it was just one fatal shot that took him from us," Celedon said.One man who was shot, Michael Barajas, told WDAF he was thinking of his children and was determined to make it back home.Barajas was in the bar playing pool before the shooting."About the time I see the fire come out the gun, then I felt the hit in my arm. It felt like I got hit with a bus, just almost knocked me to the floor," he told the affiliate.Around him, chaos, Barajas said."I was close to death. I feel like a couple inches in a different direction, I could've got hit in my head, could've got hit in my stomach, my chest. You know, a bad place," he said.
