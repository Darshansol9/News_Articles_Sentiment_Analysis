(CNN) Two men attempting to steal bigleaf maple trees started a fire in Washington's Olympic National Forest last year that ravaged more than 3,300 acres of protected land, authorities said.According to a statement from the US Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, Justin Wilke and Shawn Williams first went to the national forest in April 2018 to look for "bigleaf maple trees that might contain 'figured' wood, which is highly prized for making musical instruments."The poachers cut the trees they found and sold the blocks of wood to a lumber mill, claiming that it had been harvested on private land, the Monday statement said.Wilke and Williams returned for more wood in August 2018, after selling thousands of dollars' worth, the indictment against them said.

"The men tried to put the fire out with water bottles but were unsuccessful."Read More
