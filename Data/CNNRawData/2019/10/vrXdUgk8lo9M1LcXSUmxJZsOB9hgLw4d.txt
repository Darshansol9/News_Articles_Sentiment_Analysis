(CNN) It's enough to raise eyebrows and pop your eyes out.Yes, the unlikely duo of Rudy Giuliani and the Joker have descended upon one Ohio porch in the form of giant pumpkins.President Trump's personal attorney in pumpkin caricature weighs in at 277 pounds, while his associate punches in at 108 pounds of terror. Jeanette Paras is the creator of these painted caricatures , who she's dubbed RudyKin Giuliani and the Joker (sorry, no pumpkin puns here)."Every year I look at those in the news and who or what is the hot topic of the conversation and who does so cutting across culture sports, entertainment and even more," Paras told CNN. "Well this year Rudy Giuliani has been in the news a lot lately and he certainly is monopolizing the news."Paras has been turning giant pumpkins into caricatures of celebrities and other noteworthy people since 1988. She carefully thinks through who is making headlines that year before creating the works of art that sit on her porch in Dublin, Ohio.
