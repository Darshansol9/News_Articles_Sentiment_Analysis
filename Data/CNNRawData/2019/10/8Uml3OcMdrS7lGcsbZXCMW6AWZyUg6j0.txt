Allisa Charles-Findley, Botham Jean’s sister, testified during Amber Guyger's sentencing this afternoon.“I want my brother back,” she said as she watched a video of Botham singing at church.She put her head in her hands when the prosecutor played two videos of him singing, and she said it’s his voice that makes her miss him.Findley said she tries to call her family more since Jean's death to check on her mother, father and little brother.She shared other memories of her brother while she spoke on the stand: She recalled how her brother would call her in the middle of the night when he was in college so she could order a pizza and send it to his dorm room.And she talked about how on his birthday, he brought her a TV as a housewarming gift for her new home.
