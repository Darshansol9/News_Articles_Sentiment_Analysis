(CNN) Former New York Giants safety Kamrin Moore is asking to be reinstated to the NFL after a grand jury cleared him of the assault allegation that prompted his suspension, his agent said Wednesday.Moore's lawyer had previously said his client was not guilty of any crime. A Union County, New Jersey, grand jury found no cause to indict him on the charge, the county prosecutor's office told CNN."We have continually asserted Kamrin's innocence from the outset of this ordeal and believed that it was only a matter of time before he would be vindicated of these fabricated charges," agent Eugene Lee said.The player's defense team investigated the allegations and found they were not true, said a statement from MBK Sports, where Lee is president."Dismissal of all charges in this case is proof that sometimes the system does work," the statement said. "We are honored to clear Kamrin's name and get him back to professional football as soon as possible."Read More
