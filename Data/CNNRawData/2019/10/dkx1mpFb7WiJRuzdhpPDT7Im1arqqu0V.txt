Los Angeles (CNN) The Los Angeles Fire Department lifted its mandatory evacuation orders after a fire ripped across the hillside of the affluent Pacific Palisades area for about 10 hours Monday.The fire initially began around 10:30 a.m. PST at the base of Palisades Drive and quickly spread about 18 acres within 15 minutes. It quickly moved uphill and burned more than 40 acres of brush. About 200 homes within eight residential blocks were under threat from the flames and were heavily impacted by smoke, said LAFD Chief Patrick Butler during a press conference.Residents were alerted they could return to their homes around 8 p.m."Everyone in high fire danger areas should be cautious and ready to quickly evacuate, since fire danger weather conditions will continue to be dangerously dry and windy over the next several days," LAFD said.There were two reported injuries, one minor injury to a firefighter and one civilian who was taken to the hospital for respiratory stress, Butler said.Read More
