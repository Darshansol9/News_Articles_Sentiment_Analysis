(CNN) Atlantic City Mayor Frank Gilliam Jr. has resigned after pleading guilty to stealing about $87,000 from a local youth basketball program he co-founded."Mayor Gilliam took advantage of his victims' desire to assist underprivileged children by falsely representing that the money contributed to the AC Starz Basketball Club would go to pay for school supplies or to support youth basketball," US Attorney Craig Carpenito of New Jersey said Thursday in a statement announcing the plea deal.

Atlantic City, effective immediately. I would like to apologize to the residents ... who deserve stability and respect. My sincere apologies to each constituent that voted for me and had high hopes in my tenure," he wrote.Read More
