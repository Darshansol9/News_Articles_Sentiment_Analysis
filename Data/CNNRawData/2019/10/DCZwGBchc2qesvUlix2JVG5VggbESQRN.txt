Brentwood resident Leslie Tuchman, 75, grabbed her clothing, important papers and medication before evacuating her condo because of the Getty Fire.“I just didn’t know how fast and in what direction the fire could go. The brush was on fire on the 405 and I live five minutes from there," Tuchman said.She said she was afraid she wouldn't be able to get her car out of the garage if the power went out.“A friend called me about 6 and I turned in the TV. And I couldn’t tell what part of Brentwood it was going to go to. I live in a condo and the power goes out when it rains. So I was afraid I wouldn't be able to get the car out of the garage if the power went out," Tuchman said.Tuchman is now staying at the Westwood Recreation Center because she said feels "safe being around other people."
