(CNN) The City of New Orleans plans to bring down two cranes at the construction site of the Hard Rock Hotel that collapsed over the weekend, killing at least two people, according to New Orleans Fire Chief Timothy McConnell. Authorities are citing a potential tropical storm that could enter the area by Friday night.Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said the main concern is elevated winds from the storm that formed Thursday morning in the Gulf of Mexico, which would pose a danger to the cranes' already precarious stability. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell issued a state of emergency for the city due to the storm, as well as the partial collapse of the Hard Rock Hotel, her office said Thursday.The cranes have been shifting since the building's collapse days ago, hindering efforts in searching for one person who remains missing or retrieving bodies of the deceased.Authorities had been trying to stabilize the cranes, but announced Wednesday that the rescue mission has moved to recovery. McDonnell said it was a difficult decision, but it is unlikely that the missing person survived.How will authorities blow them up?Read More
