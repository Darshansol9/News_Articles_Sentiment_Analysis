(CNN) Investigators have found the cockpit voice recorder of a plane that crashed during takeoff in Addison, Texas, plowing through an airplane hangar and killing all 10 people aboard, National Transportation Safety Board officials said Monday.The recordings on the so-called black box were being downloaded and analyzed in Washington, DC, Jennifer Rodi, a senior air safety investigator with the NTSB, told reporters during a news conference. The recorder is expected to provide details of conversations between the crew and air traffic control, as well as conversations between the crew members."What we know at this point, the communication seemed to be completely normal," NTSB Vice Chair Bruce Landsberg said. "We are not aware of any additional communications between the crew and air traffic control."Investigators are also interested in what was said between the pilot and copilot in the minutes before the Beechcraft Super King Air 350 aircraft crashed and killed them and the eight passengers aboard.Five of the 10 victims have been identified and next of kin notified, according to the Dallas County medical examiner's office. They have been identified as Brian Mark Ellard, 53; Stephen Lee Thelen, 58; Matthew Palmer, 27; Alice Maritato, 15, and Dylan Maritato, 13.Read More
