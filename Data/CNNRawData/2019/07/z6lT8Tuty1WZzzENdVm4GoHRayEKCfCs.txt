That weapon cannot be imported into the state of California," Becerra said in response to a question about the assault-style rifle used in the shooting.Becerra added: "There is a very strong likelihood as we develop the evidence that the perpetrator in this particular case violated California law on top of the crimes of homicide and so forth, the crimes that we have that are meant to prevent individuals from carrying out this type of activity."Santino William Legan, 19, killed three people and injured at least 12 others at the festival on Sunday with the rifle he bought July 9 in neighboring Nevada, Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee told reporters Monday.

The store couldn't be reached.In a separate post the gun shop said: "The shooter in CA, I hope you rot in hell. We pray for the victims. My heart hurts for all of them."Instagram posts before shootingAn Instagram account bearing the shooter's name , created four days ago, posted two messages shortly before the attacks, including a reference to a white supremacist text.One post was a photo of people walking around the Garlic Festival with the words "Ayyy garlic festival time Come get wasted on overpriced sh**." The other post, made about an hour later, showed a sign of Smokey Bear saying "Fire Danger High Today.""Read Might is Right by Ragnar Redbeard," the caption said. "Why overcrowd towns and pave more open space to make room for hordes of mestizos and Silicon Valley white tw**s?"A "mestizo" is a person of mixed descent, usually white and Hispanic, or white and American Indian. "Might is Right" is a book published in the late 1800s which has been described as a white supremacist text that promotes anarchy, vilifies Christianity and calls Jesus the "true Prince of Evil." The natural order, according to the book, is a world at war in which the strong must vanquish the weak, and white men must rule over those of color.Smithee said police took into custody a 20-year-old man who falsely claimed to be involved in the shooting."We've determined that he was not involved in the shooting, that just thought it would be a fun way to get some attention," he said.They thought the pops were fireworks," and musicians, including Colbie Caillat and her band, Gone West, performed.

"We could smell the gunpowder."Videos of the aftermath show people screaming and fleeing to safety. Lex De La Herran was walking away as the music on stage was winding down, he said."I turned around for a quick moment and I hear the gunshot sounds," he said. "At first I thought it was fireworks but a man behind me screamed that 'those are real, those are real.'""I just froze like a deer in the headlights," he said.De La Herran said a piece of shrapnel hit him in the head. Then, he started running among the crowds."I saw people jumping over the fence, people trampling over each other, it was just widespread chaos," he said.Another screengrab taken from video and uploaded to Twitter appears to show people scrambling at the Gilroy Garlic Festival.The victimsStephen Romero, 6, was killed during the shooting, Gilroy City Council member Fred M.
