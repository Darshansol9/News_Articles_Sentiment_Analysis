(CNN) No charges will be filed in the death of a 3-year-old boy who apparently fell into a restaurant grease trap in Rochester, New York, police said Tuesday.The boy fell in the grease trap Monday at a Tim Hortons restaurant. The child's mother was an employee at the restaurant and had brought her son to work because she could not find child care that day, Rochester Police Department Investigator Francis Camp told CNN.Camp said investigators think the boy fell through a plastic lid that gave way and into the grease trap embedded in the ground outside the restaurant.The grease trap was about 2-and-a-half feet in diameter and covered with a green plastic lid -- much like a manhole cover -- that helped it blend into the surrounding grass, he said."The lid was on there, it looks like the child ran across it and it popped open and he fell into the trap," he said.Read More
