(CNN) Ready to risk your life to see some aliens? Great! So are more than 600,000 other people.A satirical Facebook event titled " Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us " is asking people to gather at the US Air Force base in Lincoln County, Nevada, to overtake the building and reveal the "secrets" it keeps.Area 51, as the facility is commonly known, has been the focus of conspiracy theories for decades, and a small but undeterred part of the population thinks it's where the government stores secret information about aliens and UFOs."We can move faster than their bullets," the Facebook page says, hinting at Area 51's strong security.It's all a big joke, of course, but the event has sparked some hilarious memes illustrating why storming Area 51 is a terrible idea.
