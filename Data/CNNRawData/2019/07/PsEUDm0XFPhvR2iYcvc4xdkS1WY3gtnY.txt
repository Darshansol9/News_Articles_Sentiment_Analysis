Christopher Gregory/Getty ImagesTwo cruise ships canceled stops in Puerto Rico Monday — a move that will cost the island's economy a lot of money.In a statement from Puerto Rico’s Tourism Company, "the economic impact of cruise ship stops canceled to date could be estimated at around $2.5 million due to the expenditure of approximately 15,000 passengers."MSC and Royal Caribbean said their cruises, the "MSC Seaside" and "Celebrity Equinox," were scheduled to arrive in San Juan.The statement said the companies made the decision because the local businesses that provide excursion services canceled most of the scheduled excursions."Similarly, the lines expressed concern about the demonstrations that could be generated in Old San Juan at night," the statement continued.Both companies will see their own economic impact from the cancelations. The statement said the "MSC Seaside" will suffer an estimated $439,000 in losses and the "Celebrity Equinox" will lose about $311,000.
