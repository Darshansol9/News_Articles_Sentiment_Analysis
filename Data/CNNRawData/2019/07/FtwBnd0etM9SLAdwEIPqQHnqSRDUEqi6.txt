Parts of Manhattan in the dark after power outageScott Heins/Getty Images Seen from the air, a large section of Manhattan's Upper West Side and Midtown neighborhoods stand coated in darkness on Saturday, July 13.Tens of thousands of people were without power in Manhattan on Saturday evening, ConEdison said.There were 45,000 customers without power in New York, most of them in Midtown Manhattan and the Upper West Side, the utility company said.Mayor Bill de Blasio, who was campaigning for president in Iowa, said it appears the outage was the result of a mechanical problem in the electrical grid."This appears to be something that just went wrong in the way that they transmit power from one part of the city to another," he told CNN. "It sounds like it is addressable in a reasonable amount of time."
