Joyce Webber, 64, has been sleeping on a cot, surrounded by her neighbors at a shelter in Baldwin, Louisiana. She lives in a trailer surrounded by trees and she didn't feel it was safe to stay there."When they say go, I go," said Webber, who's lived in the area for nearly two decades.Webber said her son, who stayed behind in the trailer, told her a tree fell onto their trailer but didn't cause major damage.Because of Hurricane Katrina, Webber said, she prefers to stay in shelters throughout major storms.Webber is among the more than 300 people who arrived to shelters in Louisiana as Tropical Storm Barry approached landfall.
