(CNN) Supermodel and reality star Janice Dickinson reached a "very large settlement" with Bill Cosby's insurance company in her defamation case, her lawyer Lisa Bloom said at a press conference Thursday.The defamation lawsuit began when Dickinson, 64, said in 2014 that Cosby had drugged and assaulted her in 1982 after the two had dinner in Lake Tahoe, Nevada. Cosby's lawyer at the time, Marty Singer, accused Dickinson of lying about it, and Dickinson then sued Cosby for defamation"Truthfully, a settlement is a victory and a measure of justice," said Dickinson, who was flanked by her attorney.Bloom said Dickinson will be "fully compensated for being called a liar" and is free to tell her story. The settlement amount will remain confidential, but Bloom described it as "epic" and later presented Dickinson with a bouquet of flowers and called this "her victory press conference."Dickinson said she lost her innocence after the rape in 1982 and "nothing can replace the before and after."
