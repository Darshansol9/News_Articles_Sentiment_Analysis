Authorities raided the Arizona facility of the Biological Resource Center and discovered bodies piled atop one another and buckets full of body parts, according to the FBI. Thirty-five relatives of people whose bodies were supposed to be donated for science research between 2010 and 2014 have sued officials who worked at the center.
