(CNN) Should the District of Columbia be its own state? A new Gallup poll finds that 64 percent of Americans say no.In a survey, more than half of participants across every category -- gender, race, age group, education level, political party and ideology -- said they would oppose the move to grant statehood to nation's capital city.Democrats and people identifying ideologically as "liberal" were less likely to oppose the idea. Fifty-one percent of Democrats and 50 percent of "liberal" people said they wouldn't be in favor of the idea.Meanwhile, of Republicans and those identifying as "conservative," 78 percent were opposed.The numbers are consistent with previous polls, according to Gallup. A Yankelovich/Clancy/Shulman poll from 1992 found that 57 percent of people opposed Washington statehood, and a Washington Post poll from 1989 found that 52 percent did.
