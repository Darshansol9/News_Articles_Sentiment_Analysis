Kennedy's goal of "landing a man on the moon and returning him safely" before the end of the decade.More than half a billion people watched on television as Armstrong climbed down the ladder of the Eagle lunar lander and proclaimed: "That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind."The CNN film "Apollo 11" explores the exhilaration of this moon landing through newly discovered and restored archival footage.
