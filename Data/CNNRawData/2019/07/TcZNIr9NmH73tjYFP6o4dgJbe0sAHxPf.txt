(CNN) When Oregon students go back to school this year, they'll be able to take mental health days without risking an unexcused absence because of a new law that was proposed by a group of high schoolers.The legislation, which Gov. Kate Brown signed last month, lets students have an excused absence if they miss school because of their mental or behavioral health.Sam Adamson, from left, Lori Riddle, Hailey Hardcastle and Derek Evans at the Oregon State Capitol in Salem.Students from across the state came up with the idea at a leadership camp last year and worked with lobbyists and mental health professionals to push for the change.Hailey Hardcastle, one of the student advocates, said mental health problems could be just as dangerous as physical ailments and should get the same consideration."You take a day off if you have a cold, because resting up will make you feel better, and if you're having a really bad anxiety attack or you're going through a bout of depression, taking a day off can make you feel better," she said.
