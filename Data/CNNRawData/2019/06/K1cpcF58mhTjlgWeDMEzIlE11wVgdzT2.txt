(CNN) A phone used by a young man who says Kevin Spacey groped him at a bar in 2016 must be turned over to the actor's defense team for examination, a Massachusetts district judge ruled.In a hearing last week, Judge Thomas Barrett allowed a defense request to examine the contents of the accuser's phone from July 7, 2016, to December 31, 2017, and denied a defense request for the phone records of the accuser's mother.Defense attorney Alan Jackson made a fresh request for the phone data Monday, accusing the prosecution of making "misrepresentations," which an assistant district attorney denied.Prosecutors had the accuser's phone information for more than a year and conducted a forensic download of the data, all while hiding the details from the defense, Jackson alleged.Judge Barrett on Friday ordered the phone to be turned over to state police by June 21 so the defense's expert could pick it up "for a full forensic imaging or extraction of the phone's contents."Read More
