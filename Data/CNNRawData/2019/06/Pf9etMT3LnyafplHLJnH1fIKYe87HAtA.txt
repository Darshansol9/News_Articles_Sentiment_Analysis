The committee held a hearing yesterday on the Mueller report (without former special counsel Robert Mueller). Watergate figure (and CNN contributor) John Dean testified at the hearing, and he compared President Trump's behavior to President Nixon's . He also said the report gave Congress "a road map" to impeachment. Meanwhile, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said he's struck a deal with the Justice Department that will allow Congress to get its hands on some documents from the Mueller report related to obstruction of justice . That will head off, for now, a court showdown between House Dems and the Justice Department.Meantime, a Judiciary subcommittee holds a hearing today on Big Tech and how it's affecting and influencing the news media .

The United Kingdom plans to ban such plastics next year, and the European Parliament passed its own single-use plastic ban back in March. There is growing concern about the amount of plastic that's ending up in the world's oceans, with an estimated 1 million birds and more than 100,000 sea mammals worldwide injured or killed when they mistake plastic for food.JUST WATCHED Plastic pollution is killing these animals Replay More Videos ...
