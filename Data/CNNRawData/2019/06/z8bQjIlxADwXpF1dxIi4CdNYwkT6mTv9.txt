(CNN) Cracker Barrel says it will not permit a Tennessee pastor who has made death threats against gay people to hold an event in one of its stores.The company, which is headquartered in Lebanon, Tennessee, just east of Nashville, said it condemned his "statements of hate and divisiveness."Grayson Fritts, the pastor who doubles as a county police detective, had planned an event at a Cracker Barrel in Cleveland, Tennessee, for his congregation, the All Scripture Baptist Church, on June 29.When the Tennessee Democratic Party caught wind of the event, chairwoman Mary Mancini shared a letter she sent to Cracker Barrel CEO Sandra Cochran asking the company to review the decision based on the pledge of inclusivity and diversity on its website, which calls for "fairness, mutual respect and equal opportunity."In an official statement on Twitter, Cracker Barrel denied any affiliation with Fritts or the church and said it wouldn't allow the Tennessee store to hold the event.We work hard every day to foster a culture that is welcoming and inclusive.
