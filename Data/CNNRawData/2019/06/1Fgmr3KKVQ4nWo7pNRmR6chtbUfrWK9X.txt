Keith Ranieres lawyer Marc Agnifilo TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP/Getty ImagesKeith Raniere's attorney, Marc Agnifilo, apologized to one of Raniere's alleged victims outside of court moments after the verdict.Barbara Bouchey left Nxivm in 2009 and is a former girlfriend of Raniere. She was not a member of DOS, a secret sex society, but prosecutors showed evidence that Raniere had explicit photos of Bouchey on his computer, and Bouchey told CNN she has been hit with numerous lawsuits from Nxivm since leaving."He said, 'I'm really sorry.' And then he said, 'I hope this is justice for you, and I know this has been really hard on you.'" Bouchey told CNN. "A part of me couldn't believe he was saying it."Agnifilo confirmed the interaction to reporters outside of court."What I do hope is I hope people find peace and solace in the verdict, I really do," Agnifilo said. "When I say it’s an emotional trial I mean for everyone. For the lawyers for the prosecutors for the people who got through this as witnesses and victims I think it’s emotional for everybody."Bouchey said she feels "enormous relief" at the verdict. Raniere faces life in prison, which Bouchey says is just punishment."This gives the judge the permission, really, to send him away for life," Bouchey said. "That's where he belongs. In jail for life. Because he's got crazy compartments in that mind. And he can't be rehabilitated in my opinion. That means if he gets out he's only going to reinvent himself and repackage it and go on thinking what he was doing was good.""There's no words to express the enormous relief," Bouchey said through tears. "Just to be able to know that I can move on and not have to worry that he's coming for us."
