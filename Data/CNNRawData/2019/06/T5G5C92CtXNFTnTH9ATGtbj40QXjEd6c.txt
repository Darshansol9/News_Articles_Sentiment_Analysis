She wasn't sure where the giant piece of metal came from.Nearby Nellis Air Force Base confirmed the panel belonged to an A-4 military plane operated by Draken International, a military aircraft contractor. The plane lost the part during a "routine training mission," but the cause is still unknown, Draken officials said.An official from Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas examines the plane part, which fell from a craft into a neighborhood nearby.Federal Aviation Administration officials arrived shortly after the incident.
