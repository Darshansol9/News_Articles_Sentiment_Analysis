(CNN) Wouldn't you know it, Serena Williams is making history again. The tennis legend is the first athlete to ever make Forbes' list of richest self-made women in America."I want to be a part of it," she tells Forbes. "I want to be in the infrastructure. I want to be the brand, instead of just being the face."Kylie Jenner of Kardashian fame is also on the list. Last July, Forbes raised some impeccably-shaded brows when it named the reality star-turned-beauty-empress, then 21, the "youngest ever self-made billionaire." Some critics argued the publication was playing fast and loose with the term "self-made," since Jenner started with a healthy amount of capital, both financial and social, from her famous family.
