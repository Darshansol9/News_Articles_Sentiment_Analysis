Taylor Bush went by Nana's Home Daycare in Cleveland to pick up her 2-month-old daughter, she says she knew something was wrong. The child, Di'Yanni Griffin, was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. The county's medical examiner performed an autopsy and is waiting on the results, the office's external affairs manager told CNN.
