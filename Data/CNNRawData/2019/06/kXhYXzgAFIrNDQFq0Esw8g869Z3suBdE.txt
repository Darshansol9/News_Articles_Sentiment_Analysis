(CNN) Harvard University's RoboBee has became the lightest vehicle to ever achieve sustained untethered flight, not requiring jumping or liftoff.For nearly a decade, the little robot does look a little like a bee, has been tethered to a power source. That meant RoboBee, which weighs 259 milligrams and is a project in Harvard's Microrobotics Lab, has never been able to have true freedom, and its flight has been limited.But with this development, which was published this month in the journal Nature , that's changing. And though the RoboBee still can't fly outside yet, it could have a significant effect on commercial technology."Over the life of this project we have sequentially developed solutions to challenging problems, like how to build complex devices at millimeter scales, how to create high-performance millimeter-scale artificial muscles, bioinspired designs, and novel sensors, and flight control strategies," said Robert Wood, one of the researchers involved in the project, in a statementThe RoboBee needs the power of three suns to fly, but researchers are working to change thatRead More
