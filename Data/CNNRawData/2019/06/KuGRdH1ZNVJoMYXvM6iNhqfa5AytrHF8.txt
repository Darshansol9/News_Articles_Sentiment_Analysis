(CNN) Samples taken from at least one minibar at the Bahia Principe Hotel are being tested by the FBI as part of the agency's collaboration with Dominican Republic authorities, Ministry of Health communications director Carlos Suero said Wednesday.Suero added that an extensive collection of samples is taken by Domincan authorities when someone dies in a hotel room. Minibars are tested for bacteria and water from showers and sinks are examined, he said.The FBI is assisting with the toxicology tests of three of the nine Americans who have died in the Dominican Republic in the past year, he said.Last week the US Embassy announced the FBI involvement in toxicology analysis and said results might take up to 30 days.The spate of deaths has left many Americans wondering if they should cancel their upcoming trips to the Caribbean paradise.Officials in the Dominican Republic have called the deaths isolated events as they work to reassure travelers their country is safeThe family of one of the American tourists who died there in recent months wants pathologists in the United States to examine his body for a cause of death, his brother told CNN on Wednesday.Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, was found dead last week in his hotel room, his family said, making him at least the ninth US tourist to die at a Dominican Republic resort , or after becoming ill at one, over the past 13 months.Preliminary autopsy results suggest Allen suffered from cardiac arrest, and there we no signs of violence, according to a report Dominican authorities gave to CNN.But a doctor had just given Allen a clean bill of health during a physical, his brother, Jason Allen, told CNN's "New Day," adding that he is having a hard time understanding how Joseph could have died suddenly. The family is arranging for the body to return to the US."If we don't feel like we're getting the help we need from (Dominican authorities) and the answers we need from them, we'd like to get some kind of testing done on American soil by American doctors to help us to understand what could have been the cause of my brother's death," Jason Allen said.Of the nine Americans who have died while or after visiting a Dominican Republic resort since June 2018, it's not clear how many deaths owed to natural causes."In the last five years, over 30 million tourists have visited the Dominican Republic, but this is the first time the international media report such an alarming situation," Tourism Minister Francisco Javier Garcia said earlier this month. "These are isolated incidents, and the Dominican Republic is a safe destination."What we know about Joseph Allen's deathJoseph Allen was a repeat guest of the Hotel Terra Linda in the coastal Dominican city of Sosua, and he was there last week with friends, Jason Allen told HLN on Tuesday . The resort was Joseph Allen's spot, "his Cheers," the brother said, referring to the legendary sitcom pub.Joseph Allen died June 13 after falling ill in the Dominican Republic, his family says.Allen's friends told the family that he'd complained last Wednesday about not feeling well."He complained about being really hot," Jason Allen told CNN. "His friend looked at him -- he was sweating bullets. (Joseph) took a shower, cooled off, said he felt a lot better."He was going to hang out that night (but) decided, 'You know what, I feel better, but I don't feel well enough to go hang out, so I'm just going to relax in the room and read.'"Hotel staff found him dead in his room early Thursday after friends expressed concern that he hadn't met up with them that morning, his sister, Jaimie Reed, told CNN.Jason Allen has no reason to believe his brother was killed intentionally, he said. But he wonders if anything at the hotel -- the air, the drinks -- contributed to his death."What I do know is that I want no one and their family to endure what we're enduring right now," he told HLN.At least 9 died on vacationBesides Joseph Allen on June 13, the deaths of American citizens during or after stays at Dominican Republic resorts in the last 13 months include these cases:• Leyla Cox, 53, of New York City, died June 10 in her room at the Excellence Resorts in Punta Cana.The cause of death was heart attack, the hotel stated, citing a forensics report.
