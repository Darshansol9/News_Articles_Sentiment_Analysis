(CNN) The man behind the American pastime of paint-by-numbers pictures died on April 1 at the age of 93. according to his son. Dan Robbins created the first pictures and helped popularize paint-by-numbers kits in the 1950s.Robbins' son, Larry, said his dad was working as a package designer for the Palmer Paint Company in Detroit when he came up with the idea for paint-by-numbers in the late 1940s. He worked there as a graphic artist and sold children's paint that was washable.The idea for paint-by-numbers started when Robbins' boss asked him to come up with an item that could be geared towards adults. Robbins got inspiration for the product from Leonardo da Vinci. The famous artist would hand out numbered designs to apprentices.
