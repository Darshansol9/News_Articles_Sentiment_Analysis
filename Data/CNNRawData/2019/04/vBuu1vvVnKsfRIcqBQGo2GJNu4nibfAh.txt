(CNN) A Florida judge Tuesday sealed the video allegedly showing New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft during a prostitution sting at a Florida day spa.Palm Beach County Judge Leonard Hanser temporarily sealed the video based on Kraft's fair trial rights, and ruled that it can be released once a jury is sworn, the case is resolved via plea agreement or the prosecutors decide they no longer wants to pursue the charges.Hanser said that while the underlying charge in the case is only a misdemeanor, it "places in sharp contest issues fundamental to society" -- including the media's First Amendment rights and the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial."A seventy-eight-year old man walks into a day spa and, in addition to receiving conventional spa services, he allegedly engages in illegal sexual activity," Hanser wrote in his ruling. "That seems like a rather tawdry but fairly unremarkable event."He added, "But if that man is the owner of the most successful franchise in, arguably, the most popular professional sport in the United States, an entirely different dynamic arises, especially if the encounter is captured on videotape, and the incident is the focus of much media attention and pre-trial publicity."
