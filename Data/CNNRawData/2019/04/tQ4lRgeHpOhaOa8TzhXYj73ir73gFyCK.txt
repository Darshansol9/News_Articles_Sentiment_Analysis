(CNN) Judy Clark, a former radical activist who has spent nearly 40 years in jail for her role in a 1981 robbery of a Brink's armored truck in suburban New York, has been granted parole, her attorney said."We are grateful that the Parole Board affirmed what everyone who has interacted with Judy already knows -- that she is a rehabilitated, remorseful woman who poses no threat to society," said Clark's attorney, Michael Cardozo.The 69-year-old former radical activist was convicted of murder in the Nyack, New York, robbery that left security guard Peter Paige and Nyack police officers Edward O'Grady and Waverly Brown dead, according to court documents.Clark participated in the crime with other activists, and described herself as a "single-minded fanatic ... at war with America" and "a blinded revolutionary," according to New York State Department of Corrections records.Prosecutors criticized the parole board's decision and described Clark as a "cold-blooded cop killer" who chose to participate in "bank robbery, anarchy and murder."Read More
