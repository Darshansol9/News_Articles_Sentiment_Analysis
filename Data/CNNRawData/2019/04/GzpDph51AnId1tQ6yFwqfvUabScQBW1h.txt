(CNN) South Carolina fifth-grader Raniya Wright -- the girl who died last month after a fight at her elementary school -- died of a blood-vessel rupture in the brain stemming from a birth defect, and there's no evidence the fight contributed to her death, a prosecutor said Friday.The death of Raniya, 10, will be attributed to natural causes in a report next week, and no criminal charges will be filed in the case, district solicitor Duffie Stone told reporters Friday."There was no evidence of trauma on or inside the body of Raniya Wright that would indicate that any fight in any magnitude contributed to her death," Stone said at a news conference, announcing the initial results of the investigation into the young girl's death.Stone said he made the determination after pathologists and other doctors conducted postmortem tests at the Medical University of South Carolina, where Raniya died March 27.Raniya was involved in a "five- to 10-second slap fight" with another student in a classroom at Forest Hills Elementary in Walterboro on March 25, and a teacher separated them, Colleton County Sheriff R.A. Strickland said Friday. Raniya had no sign of and spoke of no injury, but complained of a headache about 10 minutes later at the principal's office, he said.Read More
