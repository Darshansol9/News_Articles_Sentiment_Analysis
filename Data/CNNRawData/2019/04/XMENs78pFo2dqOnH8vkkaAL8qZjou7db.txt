(CNN) North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper on Thursday vetoed a bill that would have required doctors to try to preserve the life of any infant born alive during an attempted abortion.The state's Republican-controlled Legislature had passed the bill, called the "Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Act," this week.In a letter announcing his veto, Cooper, a Democrat, wrote that laws "already protect newborn babies, and this bill is an unnecessary interference between doctors and their parents.""This needless legislation would criminalize doctors and other healthcare providers for a practice that simply does not exist," Cooper wrote.Under the proposed law, if an infant were born alive during an abortion attempt against it, any health care practitioner there would be required to "exercise the same degree of professional skill, care and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child as a reasonable diligent and conscientious health care practitioner would render to any other child born alive at the same gestational age."Read More
