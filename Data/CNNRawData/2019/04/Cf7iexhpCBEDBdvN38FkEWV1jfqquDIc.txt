(CNN) Five companies are under investigation following the collapse of a Seattle crane that crushed cars on the street below and left four people dead -- including a college freshman and a retired city employee.Washington State Department of Labor & Industries spokesman Tim Church said it may take up to six months to complete an investigation into the collapse."We expect we will likely need most if not all of that time," Church told CNN.
