(CNN) Zoo Miami is celebrating the birth of its newest addition: a rare baby rhino.The newborn is making history by being the first successful birth of the species as a result of induced ovulation and artificial insemination, according to the zoo.The rhino, whose gender is unknown, was born on Tuesday at 12:30 a.m. and is the first baby for Akuti, a 7-year-old greater one-horned Indian rhinoceros. Both mother and baby, which doesn't have a name yet, seem to be doing well, but the zoo will know more once the veterinary team is able to do a full exam."This will be performed when the staff feels that it can safely separate the infant from its very protective mother for the few minutes that the exam will take," the zoo said. "It is critical that the mother and newborn are able to establish a bond, which can sometimes be a challenge for first-time mothers."Yesterday, after an over 15 month pregnancy, "Akuti," a 7 year old Greater One Horned Indian Rhinoceros, gave birth at approximately 12:30am! This is only the second successful birth of this very rare species in the zoo's history.Video: Ron @RonMagill pic.twitter.com/jc833YgzvU â€” Zoo Miami (@zoomiami) April 24, 2019This is a big win for conservation, because this species is heavily poached for its horn. There are around 3,500 Indian rhinos left in the world, according to the International Rhino Foundation. The gestation period of Indian rhinos is between 15 and 16 months and mothers only give birth to one calf every two to three years.Read More
