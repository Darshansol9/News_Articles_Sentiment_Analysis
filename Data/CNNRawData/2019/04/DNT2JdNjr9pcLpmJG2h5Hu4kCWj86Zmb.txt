(CNN) A warm spring day can bring visitors to Lake Michigan expecting to wiggle their toes in the sand, but someone is trying to ruin a day at the beach.Thousands of glass shards were found spread across hundreds of yards of coastline at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. A park visitor first reported the glass-covered stretch of beach near the park's Good Harbor picnic area, said Tom Ulrich, the park's deputy superintendent.National Park Service rangers removed 2,500 pieces of glass from the beach during the first cleanup, he said."The volume of glass, fairly uniform in size, and the fact that it's not dumped in one spot like someone dumping garbage... it seems to us that it's malicious intent," Ulrich told CNN.This isn't the first time glass has been dumped at the park. In October 2017, large quantities of glass spread along a beach near the Lane Road parking area in Port Oneida. No suspects were identified, and the incident is still under investigation. Rangers are hoping this time someone has more information.Read More
