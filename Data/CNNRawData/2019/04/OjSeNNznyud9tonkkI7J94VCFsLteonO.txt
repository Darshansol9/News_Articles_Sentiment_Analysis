(CNN) An African-American employee who claimed she was subject to stress and racial harassment after she complained about a coworker's "Blue Lives Matter" flag and after she put up an "equity wall" has settled her lawsuit with an Oregon county, her attorney said Friday.As part of the $100,000 agreement, Karimah Guion-Pledgure resigned from her job with the Multnomah County Department of Community Justice, her attorney, Ashlee Albies, said in an email.Guion-Pledgure, who was a corrections technician until Friday, can reapply for other positions, Albies said.In a lawsuit filed in January 2019, Guion-Pledgure says she and other black coworkers initially complained when a probation officer hung a "Blue Lives Matter" flag in the workplace in 2017.Guion-Pledgure, who had been with the county since 2011, maintains that the Blue Lives Matter flag "co-opts" the Black Lives Matter movement's slogan, and "repurposes it to shift focus to law enforcement — a chosen profession, not a racial identity — and thus denigrates, dilutes, and demeans the purpose of the Black Lives Matter movement," according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by CNN.Read More
