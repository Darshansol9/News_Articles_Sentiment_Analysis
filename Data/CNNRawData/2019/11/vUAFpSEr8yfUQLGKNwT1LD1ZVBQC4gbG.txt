(CNN) Scientists from NASA have opened up an untouched Moon rock and soil sample that was brought back by the Apollo 17 lunar mission, which returned to Earth in December 1972.The samples were opened on Tuesday as a part of NASA's Apollo Next-Generation Sample Analysis (ANGSA) initiative.The purpose of these tests is to practice techniques in order to study future samples collected from the Moon on Artemis missions, which is NASA's mission to land the first woman and next man on the Moon by 2024."Opening these samples now will enable new scientific discoveries about the Moon and will allow a new generation of scientists to refine their techniques to better study future samples returned by Artemis astronauts," said Francis McCubbin , NASA's astromaterials curator. "Our scientific technologies have vastly improved in the past 50 years and scientists have an opportunity to analyze these samples in ways not previously possible."NASA opened an untouched lunar sample from the Apollo 17 mission.Most of the samples that were brought back from the Apollo missions have either been studied or are part of ongoing research at NASA. However, a number of samples were carefully stored and set aside to be tested with more advanced technology as it is developed.Read More
