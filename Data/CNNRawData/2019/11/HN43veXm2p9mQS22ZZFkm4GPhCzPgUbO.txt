He won an Oscar for directing 1967's "The Graduate," four Emmys for his work on "Wit" and "Angels in America," and nine Tony Awards, the most recent for his direction of a 2012 production of "Death of a Salesman."

Oh, he also writes fart jokes Hide Caption 11 of 17Photos: The EGOT club Whoopi Goldberg became famous for a one-woman show on Broadway, which -- ironically -- won her a Grammy, not a Tony.
