(CNN) There's no Thanksgiving like Friendsgiving -- and this month, "Friends" fans will be able to watch all the show's Thanksgiving episodes in movie theaters.The hit NBC sitcom, which marked its 25th anniversary last month, followed six friends through their life in New York. The show ran for 10 years -- and in that decade, we got to see Joey, Rachel, Ross, Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler share lots of Thanksgivings together.There was the time Chandler forlornly made jokes from inside a box. There was the time Rachel tried and failed to make trifle, proving yet again that Joey will eat anything and everything. And, of course, everyone's favorite -- the time Monica put a turkey on her head, prompting Chandler to accidentally profess his love.Fans can rewatch all of these beloved moments on the big screen in the lead-up to Turkey Day. Eight classic Thanksgiving episodes, which have been newly remastered in 4K resolution, will be screened at 700 movie theaters across the United States on November 24 and 25. The two-day screening will show four episodes a day.Tickets go on sale Friday on Fathom Events , which is owned by AMC Entertainment.Read More
