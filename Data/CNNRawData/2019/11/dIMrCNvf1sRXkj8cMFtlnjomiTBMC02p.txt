(CNN) Just over a year after the Confederate monument was pulled down by protesters, the University of North Carolina System announced the statue commonly known as "Silent Sam" will be given to a Confederate history group. A $2.5 million charitable trust will go toward its care and preservation -- a move that angered critics of the statue.The UNC system announced Wednesday that Silent Sam would be given to the North Carolina Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which will now own all rights, title and interest in the monument as part of a legal settlement after the group sued the system, according to the news releaseThough it's not stated where exactly the statue will go, the settlement states that the statue cannot be located in any of the 14 counties containing a UNC system school.UNC-Chapel Hill, where the monument was previously located, will fund a charitable trust of $2.5 million using non-state funds to be used for the upkeep of the monument and "potentially a facility to house and display the monument," the release stated.In an email obtained by CNN that was sent to students and faculty, Interim UNC-Chapel Hill Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz offered his "deepest appreciation" to members of UNC's Board of Governors and the system's interim president following the announcement, thanking them for "resolving this matter."
