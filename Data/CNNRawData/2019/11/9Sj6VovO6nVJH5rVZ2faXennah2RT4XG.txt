Chicago (CNN) After more than 30 years with the Chicago Police, Superintendent Eddie Johnson is retiring."It's time for someone else to pin these four stars on their shoulders," Johnson announced Thursday at a news conference, holding back tears. "These stars can sometimes feel like you're carrying the weight of the world. But I'm confident that I leave CPD in a better place than when I became superintendent."Johnson will continue to serve in the role through the end of the year, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said.Johnson told reporters he wanted to spend more time with his family and added he started thinking about stepping down after a memorial service for fallen officers in September."Losing those officers was hard," he said.
