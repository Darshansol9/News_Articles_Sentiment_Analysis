(CNN) Cleveland Browns defensive lineman Myles Garrett is appealing the indefinite suspension he received from the NFL after he struck another player with a helmet, according to a source with direct knowledge of the appeal.Garrett's appeal will be heard Wednesday by two appeals officers, James Thrash and Derrick Brooks, who are jointly appointed by the NFL and the NFL Players Association, the source said.The NFL suspended Garrett following an on-field brawl last Thursday night that saw Garrett rip off Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph's helmet and strike him on the head with it.CNN has reached out to the NFL and the player's union for comment. The latter declined to make a statement.Garrett's minimum suspension puts him out for six regular season games and any playoff games this year. The six games alone would make it one of the longest suspensions for on-field incidents in NFL history. He is asking for the penalty to be reduced.
