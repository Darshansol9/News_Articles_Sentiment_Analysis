His father killed himself.The boy's mother had taken out a restraining order against the father of her children days before the shooting, according to Lt. Matt Dobbs with San Diego's homicide unit."We believe the male came over... there was some kind of disagreement and he used a handgun and shot his family before turning the gun upon himself," Dobbs said on the day of the shooting.The first call came in to police at 6:49 a.m., when a dispatcher heard arguing and someone being asked to leave, Dobbs said. As police headed to the scene, a relative next door called police and reported hearing arguing and what sounded like a nail gun.Read More
