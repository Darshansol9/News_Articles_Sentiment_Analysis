(CNN) Heather Heyer's mother is suing her daughter's imprisoned killer for $12 million -- but she doesn't expect to see a penny.Susan Bro is aware of the controversies surrounding John Hinckley Jr., the man who shot President Ronald Reagan, and Charles Manson attempting to profit off of their stories, so her lawsuit in Charlottesville, Virginia, Circuit Court serves as a pre-emptive blow, she told CNN on Thursday."I want to make sure he doesn't get rich off this," she said. "I want to send a strong message to others who would try to murder people as an act of terror ... that there are going to be serious consequences that are going to follow you."To be clear, James Fields Jr. doesn't appear to be going anywhere he could make any serious coin. He's facing centuries of jail time in Heyer's August 2017 death after Virginia and federal judges separately handed down life sentences for the 22-year-old. The state judge sentenced him to an additional 419 years as well.JUST WATCHED Heyer's mom: How could I not be strong? Replay More Videos ...
