(CNN) One Ohio county had an "unusually high number" of overdose deaths in a little over a day, the county's coroner said."As of about 10 am this morning we have had 10 people die of overdoses in about 26 hours," Franklin County Coroner Dr. Anahi Ortiz said on Facebook on Sunday.Ortiz told CNN on Monday that in a normal 24-hour period, Franklin typically has one or two overdoses."I urge friends and family of those who use to make sure you are armed with naloxone," Ortiz said on Facebook. "Those who use should also test before using with fentanyl testing strips."Fentanyl can be mixed with cocaine and methamphetamine to create a deadly combination, the coroner said.
