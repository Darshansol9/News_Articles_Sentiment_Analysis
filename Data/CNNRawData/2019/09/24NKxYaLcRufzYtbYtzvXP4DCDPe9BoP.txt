Adjudication was deferred, though the details of the case were not immediately available. His record also includes a 2018 traffic citation for a federal motor carrier safety violation, according to Ector County court records.Ator was pulled over by Texas troopers in Midland on Saturday afternoon for failing to use his signal, police said.
