Merriam-Webster announced Tuesday that the word "they" can be used to refer to a single person whose gender identity is nonbinary along with three other separate definitions.Merriam-Webster uses the word in a sentence as an example: "I knew certain things about ... the person I was interviewing.... They had adopted their gender-neutral name a few years ago, when they began to consciously identify as nonbinary -- that is, neither male nor female. They were in their late 20s, working as an event planner, applying to graduate school.""Much has been written on they, and we aren't going to attempt to cover it here," a post on the dictionary's website reads.
