(CNN) Monica Iken-Murphy wanted her husband, who was killed on September 11, to always be part of her life. So she used the diamonds from her wedding ring to create a new one when she remarried.Now, she is pleading for the return of her ring and two diamond bands that disappeared last month after she left them on night stand in a home a co-worker rented in Westhampton, New York. Iken-Murphy said she reported the rings missing to Southampton police, who are investigating them as stolen."I just need my rings," Iken-Murphy told HLN's Lynn Smith on Wednesday. "It's not about money for me. It's about how meaningful they are, and what significance they have."There is a reward of $10,500 for the return of the rings, Iken said. Most of the money comes from two donors, including a board member of September's Mission, the nonproft Iken founded in 2002 that seeks to preserve the legacy of the terrorist attacks victims, including first responders who have died from 9/11-related illnesses and those who continue to suffer.MISSING WEDDING RING with 2 diamond bands #WESTHAMPTON LAST SEEN 8/12/19I DESIGNED IT SO IT IS ONE OF A KIND pic.twitter.com/pGbFGaz8ja â€” monica iken (@monicareedman) August 17, 2019Iken-Murphy met her late husband Michael Iken on Sept. 11 1999.
