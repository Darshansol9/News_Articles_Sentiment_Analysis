Eric Raney told CNN."This is all just part of the ongoing investigation," Raney said. "The Coast Guard was assisted by ATF which is investigating the fire and the FBI which has expertise in criminal investigations."Of the 39 people who were aboard the 75-foot dive boat Conception that weekend, only five crew members were found alive.
