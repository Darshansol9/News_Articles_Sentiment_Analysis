She's been so sweet to me, so thank you for this. Thank you."After Gauff finished her interview, she said, "Thank you, Naomi. I don't want people to think that I'm trying to take this moment away from her, because she really deserves it."Before ESPN could ask Osaka a question, she went up to Gauff and gave her another hug, which drew roars from the crowd.Osaka then was asked what it is like to mentor someone like Gauff."I don't think I'm a mentor," Osaka said to ESPN, and then turned to Gauff's player box, which included the teen's parents. Both Osaka and Gauff live in Florida and have known each other for a few years."You guys raised an amazing player," Osaka said through her own tears."I remember I used to see you guys training in the same place as us," Osaka continued. "For me, like the fact that both of us made it, and we're both still working as hard as we can, I think it's incredible. I think you guys are amazing. I think, Coco, you're amazing."A moment that transcends the sport...#USOpen üôå pic.twitter.com/dBQC3EUWX6 ‚Äî US Open Tennis (@usopen) September 1, 2019'It's better than crying in the shower'Gauff became an overnight sensation in July when she reached the fourth round of Wimbledon, beating the likes of Venus Williams in the process.In her run, she also became the first 15-year-old to reach the last 16 at Wimbledon since Martina Hingis in 1996. Gauff's Wimbledon came to an end at the hands of eventual champion Simona Halep, who lost Thursday to 23-year-old American Taylor TownsendIn her post-match press conference with reporters Saturday, Gauff said Osaka "really showed sportsmanship.""After the match, I think she just proved that she's a true athlete," Gauff said. "For me the definition of an athlete is someone who on the court treats you like your worst enemy but off the court can be your best friend. I think that's what she did tonight."Congratulations to @Naomi_Osaka_, who showed greatness on and off the court. @CocoGauff now knows what she needs to do to get to No. 1. How fortunate we all are to have witnessed the dawning of a new era in women's tennis. #USOpen ‚Äî Billie Jean King (@BillieJeanKing) September 1, 2019Gauff also said she was glad she was able to experience that moment with Osaka, and she shared some of what Osaka said to her."She told me it's better than crying in the shower," Gauff said. "She convinced me, like, multiple times to stay. I kept saying no. Finally I said, 'OK, I'll do it.' Because I didn't know what to do. I'm happy that she kind of convinced me to do it because, I mean, I'm not used to crying in front of everyone."For Osaka, she said her decision to ask Gauff to do the interview with her was instinctive."When I shook her hand, I saw that she was kind of tearing up a little," Osaka said to reporters at her press conference. "Then it reminded me how young she was."For me, at least when I lose, I just come into the locker room and I cry, then I do press, like, here. I love you guys, but it's not the greatest. Then I was thinking normal people don't actually watch the press conferences unless they're, like, fan fans."The people that are out there, they're probably going to just stay and watch the next person who's playing, then they go home, and they wouldn't know immediately what's on her mind."I was just thinking, like, it would be nice for her to address the people that came and watched her play. They were cheering for her."JUST WATCHED Meet Coco Gauff, the 15-year-old who rocked Wimbledon Replay More Videos ...
