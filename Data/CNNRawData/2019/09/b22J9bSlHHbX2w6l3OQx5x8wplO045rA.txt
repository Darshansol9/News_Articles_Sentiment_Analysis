The 6-foot 6-inch 300-pounder has suffered various setbacks -- including a spell in alcohol rehab -- over the past three seasons, all of which yielded losing records. Sabathia, who won a ring with the Yankees in 2009, will likely retire after this season, his last under contract. He stands as the active leader in career strikeouts and second in career wins. Hide Caption 12 of 22Photos: MLB 2017: Pitchers dominate top 20 baseball earners No. 9 (tied): John Lester, $25 million – With a 19-5 record, John Lester had the best MLB winning percentage in 2016 and finished second in Cy Young voting.

The righty's 19-3 season in 2015 with the Dodgers earned him a six-year $207 million deal. Though Grienke's record dipped to 13-7 in Arizona last season, he did earn his third straight Golden Glove award. Hide Caption 20 of 22Photos: MLB 2017: Pitchers dominate top 20 baseball earners No. 1: Clayton Kershaw, $35.571 million – Before an injury-plagued 2016, Clayton Kershaw was the most consistent pitcher in the game. He posted the NL's lowest ERA during a four-year stretch between 2011 to 2014. In addition to his three Cy Young awards -- all with the Los Angeles Dodgers -- Kershaw is one of only 10 pitchers in history to win MVP and Cy Young awards in the same season (2014). The righty is entering the third of a seven-year, $215 million deal. Hide Caption 21 of 22
