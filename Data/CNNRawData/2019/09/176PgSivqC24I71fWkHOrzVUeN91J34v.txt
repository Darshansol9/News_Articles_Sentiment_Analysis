(CNN) An Ohio video gamer who played a role in a hoax phone call that led police to kill a man in Kansas was sentenced Friday to 15 months in prison, authorities said.Casey S. Viner, 19, was one of three defendants in a case of "swatting" -- making a false report to send police somewhere -- that led Wichita police to erroneously shoot and kill 28-year-old Andrew Finch at his front door in December 2017.Authorities said Viner asked one of the co-defendants to make the call because of an argument over an online video game -- an argument that turned out not even to have involved Finch.Viner, of a Cincinnati suburb, was sentenced in federal court in Wichita after pleading guilty to one count each of conspiracy and obstructing justice, the US attorney's office for Kansas said."Swatting is not a prank, and it is no way to resolve disputes among gamers," US Attorney Stephen McAllister said .
