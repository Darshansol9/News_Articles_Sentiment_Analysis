These displays depicted black people as lazy, ignorant, cowardly or hypersexual. It was racist and offensive then and still is today.A lot of regular people have made headlines for blackface -- too many to name -- so we'll focus on the ones involving lawmakers.Blackface depictions are not always limited to the United States and Canada.
