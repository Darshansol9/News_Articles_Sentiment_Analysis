(CNN) Dorian has moved out to sea after wreaking havoc from the Bahamas to Canada, but its high winds were still hitting Nova Scotia Monday morning.All schools in Nova Scotia were closed Monday after Dorian tore across Canada's Atlantic coast early Sunday, knocking out power despite losing some strength after leaving the United States.Transit operations in Halifax will resume as normal Monday morning and officials are asking residents to consider taking public transport to reduce the number of vehicles on the road as cleanup efforts continue, a tweet from Halifax Government said.The storm was a Category 1 hurricane when it passed east of Massachusetts Saturday. It then transitioned to a post-tropical cyclone as it moved over cooler water and made landfall near Sambro Creek in Nova Scotia, Canada.Its heavy rains and powerful winds downed trees and power lines in Nova Scotia and surrounding areas, with threatening surf expected to continue to affect the coast of Canada over the next few days.
