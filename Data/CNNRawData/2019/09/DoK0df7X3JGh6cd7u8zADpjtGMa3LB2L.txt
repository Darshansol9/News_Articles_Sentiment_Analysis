New York (CNN) Authorities have identified about $1 billion in wire transfers between the owners of pharmaceutical giant Purdue Pharma, the entities they control and different financial institutions, New York Attorney General Letitia James said Friday.The discovery of the wire transfers comes as amid growing allegations by New York and other states that the Sackler family is moving billions of dollars offshore to protect their wealth. It also follows news two days ago of a proposed settlement by Purdue Pharma to thousands of states, counties, cities and tribal governments in their ongoing lawsuit accusing the company of fueling the nation's opioid epidemic.The New York attorney general's office is trying to determine how much money the Sacklers have amassed and where it is.

Sackler, a former Purdue board member, were mentioned throughout the new document.Read More
