Sign up here for the '5 Things' newsletter.Congratulations! You've made it to 2019. We could tell you about all of the New Year's food traditions you could partake in, or school you on all the new laws that go into effect today. But New Year's Day is Day 1 of keeping those resolutions we made. Below, we share ours and, in turn, we'd like to hear yours. (Let us know at 5things@cnn.com ). Here's to a joyous new year.Doug CrissWriterI really need to be more active this year. I've picked up, ahem, a few pounds of late, so in 2019 I'll focus on exercise and getting outdoors more. (And putting down the dang smartphone.) I also need to get more sleep, which is a challenge since I have to get up super early to put together this newsletter. I guess I'll need to learn how to fly the drone my wife bought me for Christmas. (If you know of good places to fly around metro Atlanta, let me know.) Of course I want to improve 5 Things (and eliminate typos!) this year. And I'll try not to be too salty if the New Orleans Saints win the Super Bowl in a couple of weeks in Mercedes-Benz Stadium, home of my beloved Atlanta Falcons. (But I'm not making any promises.)AJ WillinghamWriter2018 was a rough year for my family, so 2019 is going to be all about cherishing more quality time with the people I love most. I've already traded TV and internet binges for long conversations and productive hobbies like embroidery and woodworking. I'm also going to try to nurture my long distance friendships and be more active in my church. And this will definitely be the year I finish that romance novel I've been working on! Maybe! Whatever 2019 brings, I'll always be grateful for our Five Things family. Y'all make getting up before the crack of dawn almost enjoyable.Read More
