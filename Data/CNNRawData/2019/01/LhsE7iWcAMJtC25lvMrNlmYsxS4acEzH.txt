(CNN) Reports of rape in New York were up 22% in 2018, in part because the #MeToo movement inspired victims to come forward and tell their stories, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Thursday.De Blasio, who was speaking at the city's monthly crime statistics meeting, agreed with New York Police Department officials who cited community outreach efforts as a way to explain the peak.In all, there were 1,795 reports of rape in the city for 2018, up by 328 incidents, according to the NYPD.
