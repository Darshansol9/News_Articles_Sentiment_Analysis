(CNN) Christy Mirack's brother had one critical question left this week for his sister's killer.Since 1992, when the elementary school teacher was found murdered in her home in East Lampeter Township, Pennsylvania, Vince Mirack had pushed for answers.He often struggled to keep the case going and maintain the public's interest. He put up a billboard asking for information that could help crack the case.But authorities had no suspects.Then, thanks to a piece of gum and a water bottle, authorities identified suspect Raymond Rowe, a disc jockey known locally as "DJ Freez."
