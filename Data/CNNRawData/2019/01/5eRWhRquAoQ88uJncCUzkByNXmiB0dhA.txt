Torrance, California (CNN) A shooting at a bowling alley late Friday left three men dead and four people wounded in Southern California, and police are trying to find whoever fired the shots, authorities said.The gunshots at the Gable House Bowl in Torrance went off just before midnight. A fight -- first involving young ladies, then men -- happened shortly beforehand, sending people running, a witness said."Then ... maybe a minute and a half later, all of the sudden all we heard was, pop, pop, pop," the witness, Dana Scott, told RMG News. "Bowlers were diving under the benches. The people that were still bowling on the lanes were on the floors, underneath the seats.""People were looking for their parents, because this is a family league. You've got mothers, fathers, sons, daughters ... everybody's friends in that league," she said.No arrests were immediately reported after the shooting. City police were "working to identify the suspect(s) involved," they said in a news release.Read More
