(CNN) One third of United Nations staff and contractors feel they were sexually harassed in the last two years, according to a new UN survey.Only 17% of eligible employees replied to the survey, but the results are still striking. UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres, in a letter to staff, wrote that "the report contains some sobering statistics and evidence of what needs to change to make a harassment-free workplace real for all of us."The online survey, conducted by accounting firm Deloitte in November, was answered by 30,364 people from the UN's sprawling system.More than half of those who reported they had been sexually harassed said it happened in an office environment, while nearly three quarters said their immediate supervisors demonstrated "zero tolerance" for sexual harassment.The report said 21.7% reported they were subjected to sexual stories and offensive jokes, while 14.2% said they had been subjected to "offensive" remarks about their appearance, body, or sexual activities.Read More
