Many of the football fans packing downtown Atlanta this week won't either.But that doesn't mean they can't soak up the carnival atmosphere surrounding America's biggest sporting spectacle.Outside Mercedes-Benz Stadium are peripheral events where fans can run an obstacle course, view Pro Football Hall of Fame exhibits, ogle diamond-encrusted Super Bowl rings, kick a field goal, dance to live music, glimpse current and former NFL stars, and snap selfies next to a 35-foot-high sculpture of the Lombardi Trophy.All without paying $3,000 for a game ticket.The events run all week in this Southern capital, turning downtown Atlanta into a celebration of commerce, civic pride and, yes, football.
