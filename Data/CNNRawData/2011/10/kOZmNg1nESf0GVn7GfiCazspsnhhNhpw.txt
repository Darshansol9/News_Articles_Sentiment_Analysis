Story highlights Texas Fire Service announces full containment of the Bastrop Complex fireThe fire destroyed more than 1,500 homes as it scorched 34,000 acresFirefighters expect the next week to be quiet, thanks to recent rainfallAfter an intense fire season, the Texas Forest Service finally has a reprieve from firefighting.The Bastrop Complex fire, which torched more than 1,500 homes and 34,000 acres of land north of Austin, is now 100% contained, the Texas Fire Service said.Monday marks the first time in the 49 days that the agency wasn't facing down any fires over 100 acres. The fires this year burned more than 3.5 million acres in Texas, according to state officials.An unusual La Nina weather pattern led to a nearly 11-month fire season in the state, fire service spokeswoman April Saginor said. The agency expects the current respite from wildfires to last at least a week, thanks to drenching rainfall in the center of the state.The recent rain, however, wasn't quite enough to alleviate drought conditions in Texas. The dry spell that began a year ago is the worst the state has seen since 1895, Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst has said.
