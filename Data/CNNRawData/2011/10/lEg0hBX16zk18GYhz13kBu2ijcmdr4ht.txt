He was charged with murder numerous times through the 1990s for helping terminally ill patients take their own lives.He was convicted on second-degree murder charges in 1999 stemming from the death of a patient who suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly called Lou Gehrig's disease. He was paroled in 2007.After his release, he said he would not help end any more lives.In an interview with CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta last year, Kevorkian said he had no regrets about his work."No, no. It's your purpose (as a) physician. How can you regret helping a suffering patient?" he said.
