Story highlights The protesters face a charge of being in Grant Park after hoursPolice say they defied an order to vacate the areaChicago police arrested 130 "Occupy Chicago" protesters overnight for allegedly being in the city's Grant Park after hours, authorities said Sunday.The crowd of protesters was estimated at more than 1,000 before police announced they had to vacate the area, said Officer Robert Perez, spokesman for Chicago police. Most of the protesters left and went across the street into a public area, he said, and the rest were arrested.Those arrested were taken to police's First District headquarters, he said. The majority were booked for staying at the park after hours and released on their own recognizance, Perez said.Protesters in a number of cities, especially New York, have rallied against what they describe as corporate greed, arrogance and power, and have asserted that the nation's wealthiest 1% hold inordinate sway over the rest of the population. Other issues have also surfaced, such as disappointment with the political dynamic in Washington and U.S.-led military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.The movement has drawn criticism from some politicians who have characterized it as counterproductive, jumbled and misguided. Others, though, have lent their support and said the protesters are voicing legitimate, widespread frustrations regarding the nation's current economic and political situation.
