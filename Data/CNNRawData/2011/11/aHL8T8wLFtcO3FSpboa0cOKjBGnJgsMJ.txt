Johnny DuPree was the first black mayor of Hattiesburg, Mississippi; now, he's the first African American whose ever had a shot at becoing the governor of the state. Many of the Democrat's positions are similar to those of his Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Phil Bryant. Still, Joseph Parker, a professor emeritus of political science with University of Southern Mississippi, said a win for DuPree would be "like Moses rolling back the Red Sea."
