No water from the sky means there will be college basketball on the water Friday evening in San Diego.Well, technically not on the water but several stories above it on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson.Organizers said Thursday that rain moving toward the San Diego area would not come until Saturday, meaning the Quicken Loans Carrier Classic, pitting the North Carolina Tar Heels against the Michigan State Spartans, could be played on a court constructed on the carrier's flight deck."Right now, everything is all go for up here on the flight deck," Bob Mazza, an organizer of the event, said in a report on CNN-affliate KFMB-TV.
