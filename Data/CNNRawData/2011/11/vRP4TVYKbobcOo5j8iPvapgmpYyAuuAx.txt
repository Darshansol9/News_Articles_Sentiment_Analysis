The startup Givelocally.net combines social networking with charity by pairing up people in need with people interested in contributing to others' rent, medical costs or utility bills. None of the business' leaders -- including founder Brad Newman and chief executive Andrew Young III, son of the famed civil rights leader -- take a salary. The site stays in business by taking 18 cents of every dollar donated.
