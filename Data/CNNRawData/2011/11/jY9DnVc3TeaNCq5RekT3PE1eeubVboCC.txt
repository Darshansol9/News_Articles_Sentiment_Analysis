He said certain employers may be using the law as an excuse not to pay workers. He said he is receiving reports of racial profiling in which individuals are "being stopped simply because of their appearance."Perez also said Justice officials are increasingly concerned that some victims of domestic violence are being driven further underground because they no longer see courts as a safe haven.JUST WATCHED Alabama's immigration law under fire Replay More Videos ...

All are currently before federal courts.West said the Justice Department continues to review state immigration-laws passed in Indiana and Georgia, but has not yet filed suit against those two states.
