State College, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Hundreds of Penn State students spilled into the streets early Thursday after news that legendary coach Joe Paterno and the school's president were ousted over a child sex abuse scandal at the university.What started as an apparent celebration of Paterno turned raucous, as the crowd in the central Pennsylvania town of State College tipped over a news van and decried the media.The disturbance -- which cleared after a few hours -- came shortly after university trustees announced Wednesday night that Paterno, the winningest coach in major college football, and Penn State President Graham Spanier had lost their jobs, effective immediately."What can I say, I'm no longer the coach," Paterno told about 15 students gathered outside his house late Wednesday night. "It's going to take some time to get used to. It's been 61 years."
