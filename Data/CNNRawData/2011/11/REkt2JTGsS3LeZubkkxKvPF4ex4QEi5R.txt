Story highlights A union strike could shut down yellow bus servicesMore than 152,000 students would be affected citywideThe union is coy about whether it will strike starting MondayMayor and chancellor say a strike would be illegalSchool and city officials in New York expressed concerns Friday that a union strike could shut down yellow bus services for more than 152,000 city students beginning Monday."We regret the possibility of what could be a major disturbance in the lives of students and their families," New York City Department of Education Chancellor Dennis Walcott said in a statement.The conflict stems from an attempt to protect union jobs.The Education Department filed a bid for bus services Friday that did not include a provision to guarantee jobs for drivers from Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1181, even if their current employer doesn't win the bid.The union was coy about a possible strike."There won't be one Monday, but you never know," ATU spokesman David Roscow told CNN.New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the chancellor called a potential strike illegal. They cited a 2008 ruling from the New York state high court, which declared that including such a job-protection provision in a bid is anti-competitive.The mayor also said Friday that 300,000 subway cards had been made available to students through the schools, and he urged families to consider alternate transportation for students Monday.
