Story highlights Charity founded by Jerry Sandusky assesses futureIt is considering three options, including dissolutionGrand jury report: Sandusky met his alleged victims through Second MileThe charity founded by former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky said Friday it is considering three options for its future, including dissolution.A grand jury report says Sandusky, who was arrested two weeks ago, molested young boys after developing close relationships with them through The Second Mile, a charity he founded in 1977 for at-risk youths.David Woodle, acting CEO of the organization, said the group is "sorrowful and horrified" and is concerned most about the alleged victims and their families.In a statement, Woodle said Second Mile is working with donors and others to determine its projected support level.The three options are: restructuring the charity and keeping its programs, even in a reduced function; maintaining the programs by transferring them to other groups; or "not continuing.""Our primary goal is to sustain the programs for the sake of the kids," Woodle said.Pennsylvania's attorney general charged Sandusky, 67, with 40 counts in what authorities allege was the sexual abuse of eight young boys over several years. In addition, two Penn State officials are charged with failing to inform police of the allegations, and questions have been raised about the university's response.Second Mile is cooperating with investigators, Woodle added."As The Second Mile moves into its next phase, we will focus on helping the successful programs provided over many years continue. The overwhelming support we have received recently increases our motivation to achieve this goal," Woodle said.
