Story highlights Four commissioners say the NRC chairman "intimidated and bullied" staffThey accuse him of acting with "intemperance and disrespect"Gregory Jaczko denies the accusationsAn apparently long-running dispute between the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and its four other commissioners erupted Friday into public view when letters expressing "grave concerns" about his leadership were posted on a congressional website.The chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, said Friday in a letter to White House Chief of Staff William L. Daley that a letter written almost two months ago from four NRC commissioners "raises serious questions about Chairman (Gregory) Jaczko's conduct and ability to lead the NRC in a manner befitting the trust placed in him by the president -- who designated him -- and American citizens -- who rely on an efficient and effective nuclear regulator to protect their health, safety and security."Issa noted that his committee will address the matter next Wednesday and invited Daley to designate a witness to testify.An October 13 letter to Daley signed by the four commissioners accused Jaczko of having "intimidated and bullied senior career staff to the degree that he has created a high level of fear and anxiety resulting in a chilled work environment."According to the letter, posted on the website of the House committee, Jaczko:-- "ordered staff to withhold or modify policy information and recommendations intended for transmission to the commission;-- "attempted to intimidate the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards ... to prevent it from reviewing certain aspects of NRC's analysis of the Fukushima accident;-- "ignored the will of the majority of the commission, contrary to the statutory functions of the commission; and-- "interacted with us, his fellow commissioners, with such intemperance and disrespect that the commission no longer functions as effectively as it should."A letter to Jaczko, also dated October 13, accused the chairman of "intemperate and disrespectful behavior and conduct towards fellow commission members," and called it "unacceptable."In a detailed response to Daley, dated Wednesday, Jaczko denied the accusations."Unfortunately, all too often, when faced with tough policy calls, a majority of this current commission has taken an approach that is not as protective of public health and safety as I believe is necessary," he wrote in the letter, which was provided to CNN by his office."My sole and passionate focus since I came to the agency in 2005 has been on nuclear safety and security and I have used all of my abilities and the fullest extent of my authorities, first as a commissioner and now as the chairman, to further that vital mission," Jaczko wrote."On multiple policy issues, a majority of the commission has dismissed my policy views, as well as the recommendations of the technical staff, public interest groups, and members of Congress and established policies that have loosened the agency's safety standards."Three of the commissioners were appointed by President Barack Obama; one is a holdover from the George W. Bush administration.The commission formulates policies, develops regulations governing nuclear reactor and nuclear material safety, issues orders to licensees and adjudicates legal matters.
