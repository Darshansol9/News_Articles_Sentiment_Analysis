by John Martin, CNN(CNN) A new proposed policy regarding how teachers should address the topic of homosexuality sparked a debate at Minnesota's Anoka-Hennepin School District's meeting on Monday. The current policy, adopted in 2009, directs teachers to avoid discussions about sexual orientation. That neutrality policy is the subject of a lawsuit brought by several students. They say that school officials cannot effectively respond to bullying and harassment of gay students because of the district's current rules. The school district says it has a separate, and comprehensive, bullying prohibition policy.Supporters of the neutrality policy say that discussions about homosexuality do not belong in schools. The new policy, known as the “controversial topics curriculum policy”, could allow conversations about homosexuality, but prevents teachers from expressing their personal views. The final vote on this proposal may happen during the school board's meeting in January.
