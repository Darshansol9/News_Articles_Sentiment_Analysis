Story highlights Joe Paterno was reportedly admitted to the hospital December 11The former coach is being treated for lung cancerPaterno lost his job as Penn State's head football coach last monthFormer Penn State coach Joe Paterno has been released from a hospital, according to a source close to his family.The former football coach was admitted December 11 after fracturing his pelvis when he slipped and fell at his home, a separate source said at the time.The injury would not require surgery, the second source said. But since Paterno is being treated with chemotherapy as he battles lung cancer, doctors decided to keep him in the hospital.He was released on Friday, said the first source, close to his family.Paterno lost his job as the Nittany Lions head coach last month amid criticism that he hadn't done more when a sexual assault allegation surfaced regarding his longtime defensive coordinator, Jerry Sandusky.According to a biography on a Penn State website, Paterno was born December 21, 1926, in Brooklyn, New York, and attended Brown University. He joined the Penn State football program after graduating college in 1960, taking over as the team's head coach in 1966.In late October, a Penn State win over Illinois -- the 409th in his head coaching career -- propelled Paterno past Grambling University's legendary former coach Eddie Robinson for the most in NCAA Division I history.A week later, Sandusky -- who coached at Penn State for 23 years and remained a presence on campus after his retirement in 1999 -- was arrested and charged with 40 counts tied to allegations over a 14-year period. Ten additional charges were levied this month.An investigative grand jury's summary of testimony claimed that Sandusky engaged in fondling, oral sex and anal sex with young boys.One of the allegations came from 2002, when a graduate assistant told Paterno he'd witnessed an incident in a shower inside a school athletic facility -- a story that Paterno reported to Athletic Director Tim Curley, according to the grand jury report. The allegations didn't become known to investigators until years later.Curley and Gary Schultz, a university vice president, were both charged with one count of felony perjury and one count of failure to report abuse allegations.Paterno wasn't charged, with officials saying he did his duty by referring the allegations to his superior. But criticism quickly mounted, and Penn State trustees dismissed Paterno and school President Graham Spanier -- who initially backed Curley and Schultz -- days after Sandusky's arrest.
