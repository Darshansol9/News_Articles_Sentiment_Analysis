The girls' mother, Madonna Badger, and a friend escaped the blaze.The fire, which broke out about 5 a.m. Sunday morning in the three-story Victorian home, is believed to have been caused by smoldering embers removed from a fireplace about two hours before and taken to an area in the rear of the house, Stamford Chief Fire Marshal Barry Callahan said.The city of Stamford razed the three-story home on Monday after determining it was unsafe.
