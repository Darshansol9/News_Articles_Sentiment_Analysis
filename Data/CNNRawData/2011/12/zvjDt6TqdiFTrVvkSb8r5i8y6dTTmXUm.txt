Story highlights San Francisco authorities find sharpened stakes and a fire in Occupy campOccupy protesters clash with police after officers set up barricades around campOne officer is injured, and at least one protester is arrestedDemonstrators are divided on whether to relocateSan Francisco authorities offered Friday to move Occupy campers to another site, a day after the most recent round of violent clashes left a police officer injured, officials said.But protesters were divided over whether to relocate from their waterfront camp, authorities said.In the latest example of clashes that have occurred elsewhere in the country, the San Francisco protesters became violent after officers set up barricades around their encampment, police said.One officer sustained a hand injury, and several officers noticed that a laser was being projected in their area, said Sgt. Michael Andraychak of the San Francisco Police Department.One man was arrested and charged with making a threat against an officer and having a prohibited knife, both of which are felonies, Andraychak said.Events leading up to the clash began Thursday morning when police on a routine patrol found several large wooden stakes with sharpened points in the camp, police said.The stakes were lodged in the ground, and the exposed, pointy ends were deemed a hazard, police said.Then, during Thursday afternoon, a fire ignited inside a tent in the Occupy camp, and firefighters extinguished the flames, Andraychak said.Late Thursday afternoon, police set up barricades around the encampment for public safety reasons, police said.At that point, Occupy demonstrators attacked the officers and kicked the barricades, police alleged.Occupy protesters then walked to the Federal Reserve Bank on Market Street, where they stopped traffic, Andraychak said.The demonstrators eventually returned to their bivouacs that evening, police said.
