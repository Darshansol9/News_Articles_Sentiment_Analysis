Work has basically stopped," Bloomberg said during a press conference Thursday.The museum was scheduled to open on the 11th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks.Bloomberg blamed the holdup on "disagreements" with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is responsible for a portion of the project's financing."The Port Authority has to spend money to do the infrastructure that they agreed to," the mayor said. "We have a legitimate claim against the Port Authority for delays for roughly $140 million dollars which has increased our cost."Bloomberg did not specify when work on the museum halted. The Port Authority did not immediately respond to a request for comment.JUST WATCHED 9/11 memorial hits milestone Replay More Videos ...
