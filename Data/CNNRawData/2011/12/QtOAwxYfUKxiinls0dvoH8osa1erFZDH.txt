Story highlights Defense secretary directs commanders "to ensure hazing is not allowed"8 soldiers have been charged in connection with the suicide of an Army privateShortly after charges were filed last week in connection with the apparent suicide of an Army private in Afghanistan, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta added a pointed anti-bullying directive to a holiday message to service members around the world."I will not tolerate any instance where one service member inflicts any form of physical or psychological abuse that degrades, insults, dehumanizes or injures another service member," Panetta said in the message sent Friday. The secretary directed military commanders to "personally review" policies and ensure compliance."It is the obligation of each member in the chain of command to ensure hazing is not allowed and that all service members are treated, at all times, with genuine dignity, fairness, and respect," the secretary said.Panetta's message was sent two days after eight soldiers were charged in connection with the death of Army Pvt. Danny Chen, an infantryman with the 21st Infantry Regiment. Chen's body was found in a guard tower in southern Afghanistan on October 3. He had died of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound.
