In August, he was sentenced to death.The convictions ended a saga that began in October 2009 with the discovery of the first two victims' remains in Sowell's home in Cleveland. He eventually was accused of killing at least 11 women ranging in age from 25 to 52.Sowell's inconspicuous two-story home sat in a dilapidated Cleveland neighborhood known as Mount Pleasant. A stench hovered around the area, but no one initially realized it was the smell of decaying human flesh, instead assuming that it was a byproduct of a nearby sausage factory.In a letter to the families of Sowell's victims, Blaine Griffin, executive director of the Cleveland Community Relations Board, said the demolition "is an important step in helping our community heal and move forward.""In order to prevent actions that would be disrespectful to the memory of your loved one, your family and our community, the demolition will be performed in such a way that no piece of the property will remain," Griffin wrote in the letter.
