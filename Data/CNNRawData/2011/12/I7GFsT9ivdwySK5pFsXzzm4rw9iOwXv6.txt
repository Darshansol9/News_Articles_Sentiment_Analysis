Two years ago, Rev. Seth Kaper-Dale of The Reformed Church in Highland Park, New Jersey, made an agreement with authorities which allowed a community of Indonesians to live and work legally in the United States. The Indonesians were able to stay and work, but the authorities warned the permission could be revoked.Kaper-Dale says that more than 70 of the Indonesians recently received deportation warning letters from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security stating that they might be deported.
