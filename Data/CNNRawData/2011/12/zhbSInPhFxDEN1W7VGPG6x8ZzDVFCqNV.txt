By Kiran Khalid, CNNNew York (CNN) -- In a scathing report, the U.S. Department of Justice on Monday accused the East Haven Police Department in Connecticut of engaging in a pattern of widespread discrimination against Latinos in violation of the Constitution and federal law."We find that EHPD engages in discriminatory policing against Latinos, including but not limited to targeting Latinos for discriminatory traffic enforcement, treating Latino drivers more harshly than non-Latino drivers after a traffic stop, and intentionally and woefully failing to design and implement internal systems of control that would identify, track, and prevent such misconduct," Assistant Attorney General Thomas J. Perez wrote in a 23-page letter to the East Haven mayor, detailing the results of a two-year investigation.The letter described the discrimination as "deeply rooted in the Department's culture," and cited a statistical analysis showing how Latinos were "intentionally targeted" for traffic stops. It provided the example of a particular officer's stops -- 40.5% of which were of Latino drivers.Overall, the investigation found that 19.9% of traffic stops made by the EHPD were of Latino drivers, concluding it "shows pervasive discrimination against Latinos on every level of EHPD traffic enforcement activity." The report also said officers were able to target Latinos by focusing on customers leaving Latino businesses.Read More
