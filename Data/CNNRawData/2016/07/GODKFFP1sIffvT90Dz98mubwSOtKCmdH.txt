Story highlights No named storms in the Northwest Pacific since December 17Longest stretch without a named storm since records began in 1950Top streaks have all followed a strong El Niño similar to 2015-16Atlanta (CNN) El Niño and La Niña are commonly associated with devastating floods and crippling droughts, but the current transition from El Niño to La Niña is aiding one drought that can certainly be viewed as a positive: There hasn't been a named tropical system in the Northwest Pacific since December 17, 2015. As of Friday, that makes 198 days without a storm, tying the previous longest stretch.The Northwest Pacific is the most active basin in all of the tropics, averaging 27 named storms per year. Unlike each of the other basins around the globe, the Northwest Pacific doesn't have a defined season -- the season is simply the entire calendar year.In 2015 there was a lot of publicity about El Niño warming the Pacific and enhancing tropical cyclone activity. It seemed as if every named storm was blowing up into a monster. During 2015, there were a record 26 category 4 or 5 storms in the northern hemisphere, with the large majority of those occurring in the Pacific.This raced past the previous record of 18 category 4-5 storms.Photos: Typhoons of 2015 July 9th 2015, typhoon Chan-hom is seen from space on its approach towards China.
