Cook wrote that the Baton Rouge officers deployed their Tasers after Sterling did not comply with their orders."While the officers were attempting to subdue the subject the officers observed the butt of a gun in the subject's front pants pocket," Cook wrote."When the subject attempted to reach for the gun from his pockets the officers fired their police issued duty weapon at the subject to stop the threat.

MUST WATCH Dallas Police Chief convinced gunman was planning much larger attack 01:34During his hours-long standoff with police, Johnson said he was ready to kill more cops with bombs, Dallas Police Chief David Brown told CNN."We had negotiated with him for about two hours, and he just basically lied to us -- playing games, laughing at us, singing, asking how many (police officers) did he get and that he wanted to kill some more and that there were bombs there," Brown said.A search of the gunman's home revealed he had supplies to make explosives. Brown said police found bomb-making materials and a journal that suggested Johnson had been practicing detonations and appeared ready to take aim at larger targets.It was enough, Brown said, to have "devastating effects on our city."JUST WATCHED How police used a robot bomb to stop shooter Replay More Videos ...

Tannerite is a name-brand explosive generally used for long-range rifle target practice, when the shooter needs visual confirmation that a distant target has been hit.Other materials that could have been used for bomb-making were also discovered, but none of the material was assembled, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation said.JUST WATCHED Bookstore owner: I remember Dallas shooter's face Replay More Videos ...

But Tannerite is difficult to turn into a weapon and more difficult than other explosives to detonate, the sources said.Johnson 'liked' a group that called for violence against policeJUST WATCHED Black hate groups and online radicalization Replay More Videos ...

"And the question for law enforcement is, where do you draw the line between free speech and something else? If a message is espousing someone to take action, even if they inspire one guy to strike out, isn't that enough?"Hundreds of statements, mountains of footageJUST WATCHED Dallas gunman wrote 'RB' in his own blood Replay More Videos ...

The killer wrote those letters twice on a wall -- using his own blood -- before he was killed by a police bomb, Brown said.Johnson was wearing a bulletproof vest and had three weapons on his body, a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation said.Those weapons included a Glock 19 Gen4 pistol, a Fraser .25-caliber handgun and an Izhmash Saiga 5.45-caliber semiautomatic, assault-style rifle.A second law enforcement official said it appears all the weapons were purchased legally, and that some were bought online.Gunman's parents: He wanted to be a police officerJUST WATCHED Barack Obama reacts to wave of police shootings Replay More Videos ...

Kelly said that suspect description "aroused in Officer Yanez a reasonable suspicion to take further investigative steps leading to the stop of the vehicle."But Castile's mother said there was no justification for the killing of her son, who would have turned 33 this Saturday."I am devastated, but I have to get a message out. He is the driving force in me to make sure this doesn't happen to another mother," Valerie Castile said."My son was a humanitarian. He was a pillar in this community.
