It said no identification would be required to enter, meaning the party was open to all ages.Club Blu released a statement saying it had tried to provide a safe environment for teens."We are deeply sorry for all involved," the club posted on Facebook."We tried to give the teens WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS A SAFE PLACE TO HAVE A GOOD TIME. Ages 12-17. There was armed security as well as full security, inside and out. As the club was closing and parents were picking their children up.....that's when all this took place.

I saw a bunch of people running across the street," nearby resident Jermaine Wilson said. "It's incredible that this can happen at a teenage (event)."Basketball star slainStrawder was a high school basketball standout who was about to begin his senior year."He knew basketball was his ticket out of here, and he was well on his way," said Bernard Edwards, a family friend whose son played basketball with him.The teen ate, breathed and drank basketball, he said. But he was known for much more than his skills on the court."He would have given the shirt off his back for you," Edwards said. "He was the most special kid, the most humble,"Losing him, he said, feels like losing a son."He was always laughing and joking, just that special kind of kid," Edwards said. "It's going to be hard to overcome."One of his mentors, Dwayne Jackson, lamented the death of such a promising young man whom he recruited into his basketball ministry, "Hoops on a Mission," after meeting him when he was in the fourth grade."I am without many words this morning. As I woke up to the horrific news, my heart dropped into my stomach. Physically paralyzed," Jackson wrote on Facebook . "My heart is mourning for both teens. Stef'An Strawder was not only a part of Hoops on Mission, but a little brother to me. Since he was in 4th grade, he has always come to me about basketball and life. Before games, we would talk on the phone and I'd give him pep talks. The list goes on..."Today, I'm hurting for the amount of violence that plagues our city. The violence that breaks our city apart. But I'm holding onto God's promises."Today, I ask my city to join me in praying for every broken heart in our city mourning the losses.

They were unpacking their vehicle after a trip to Orlando when they heard the gunfire outside Club Blu."I just feel bad because I ended up taking my family from that situation to find out I moved into that situation again," Juan Santibanez told the News-Press ."As soon as I heard the shooting, my wife and kids were coming out, and we hit the floor. My wife started panicking. I just put them on the floor and got on top of them."He said the shooting happened while parents were arriving to pick up their kids."All you heard was just screaming and crying, just people in pain," he told the News-Press.More crime scenesPolice are investigating two other related scenes, one on Ortiz Avenue, where a person of interest has been detained.
