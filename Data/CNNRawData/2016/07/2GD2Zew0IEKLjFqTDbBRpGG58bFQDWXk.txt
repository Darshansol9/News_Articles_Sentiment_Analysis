It begins Tuesday or Wednesday, depending on the country one resides in and the sighting of the moon -- the old-fashioned way of determining a new month in a lunar calendar. Many Muslims still abide by that method and view it as an Eid tradition.What's a lunar calendar, anyway?For Muslims, a typical calendar doesn't serve its purpose when it comes to highlighting Islamic holidays. Muslims use a lunar calendar and determine the start of the month based on sighting the moon in the area they live. So, for traditional Muslims, (who do not choose to use an app for that), neither the start of Ramadan or Eid-al-Fitr are predictable until the night before.Following a lunar cycle, the Islamic calendar falls back 11 days every year, causing holiday dates to vary year-to-year.
