A couple in Wray, Colorado got a picture for the ages as they were heading to Wray High School's prom this weekend. Ali Marintzer and Charlie Bator were getting ready to leave, and decided to take advantage of an ominous-looking funnel touching down in the distance. Marintzer's mom Heidi told CNN affiliate KMGH she made sure the group was in no danger before snapping the epic pics.
