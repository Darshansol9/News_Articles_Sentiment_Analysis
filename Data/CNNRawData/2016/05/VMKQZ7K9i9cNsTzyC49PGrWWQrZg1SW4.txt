It's Tuesday, and here are the 5 things you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door .1. Campaign 2016It's Primary Day (again)! We'll save you some time and give you the results now: Donald Trump wins Oregon (because he's the only in the race). Bernie Sanders should win there too, so the race to watch tonight is Kentucky. This also seems like an easy V for Uncle Bernie, but Hillz was all over the state yesterday, desperately trying to make sure it isn't.2. VeteransIt's enough to make you keep your wallet in your pocket. The National Vietnam Veterans Foundation, a charity for veterans, hauled in $29 million in donations over the past couple of years. Fantastic, you say. Not quite. Less than 2% of that actually made it to veterans. You read that right -- single digits. Most of the money ended up with telemarketers. But that's not the worst part. The guy who runs this outfit is ... a veteran.3. ObamacareThe Affordable Care Act's back with the Supreme Court. Time for another dramatic ruling, right? Not this time. The Supremes punted yesterday on a challenge brought by religious groups opposed to Obamacare's contraceptive mandate. The high court sent the case back to a lower court so the opposing parties can work out a compromise. The Supremes definitely did not want to tackle this one with its current 4-4 split.JUST WATCHED Supreme Court sends contraception case to lower court Replay More Videos ...

The State Department's offering some unusually blunt warning about North Korea, telling Americans they can get in trouble there just like that. Take an unauthorized pic? Trouble. Shop at the wrong store? Trouble. "Show disrespect" unintentionally? Tough. Still trouble. And since the U.S. doesn't have diplomatic ties with the Kim team, if you go and get yourself in a bind, you'll have to depend on the Swedes.JUST WATCHED U.S., allies prepare to face North Korean missiles Replay More Videos ...

A lot of it . The bad news: They're lashing out with suicide attacks for "very spectacular headlines" to prove they're still relevant. The terrifying news: Analysts say the land loss has prompted them to change tactics, activating sleeper cells and striking soft targets.JUST WATCHED ISIS suicide bombers storm Iraqi gas plant, kill 10 Replay More Videos ...
