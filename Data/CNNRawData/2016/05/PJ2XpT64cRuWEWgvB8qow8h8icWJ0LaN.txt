They wouldn't comment on that, other than to say "we're headed in the right direction."

The other shooting suspect, Robert Lewis Dear, was declared mentally incompetent for trial for the Planned Parenthood clinic shooting in November. Dear's confessed to the killings, telling cops he dreams of being met in heaven by aborted fetuses who'll thank him for his actions.
