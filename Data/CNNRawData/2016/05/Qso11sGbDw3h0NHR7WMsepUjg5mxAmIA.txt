Story highlights Dante Servin resigns days before a departmental hearingA civilian review board found officer violated police department policyServin was accused in the 2012 shooting of unarmed Rekia Boyd; he has been acquitted(CNN) A Chicago police officer who shot and killed an innocent bystander in 2012 has resigned days before a departmental hearing that could have resulted in his firing.Dante Servin's resignation Tuesday came months after Chicago's former top cop and Mayor Rahm Emanuel called for his dismissal following a civilian-led inquiry that filed termination charges against him with the city's police board. The board was to determine his fate on Thursday.Servin's unraveling began in March 2012, when he shot and killed Rekia Boyd, 22, as she walked with a group of people in a park near her home.Servin, who was off dury, confronted the group and told them to be quiet, police said. Words were exchanged and, as Boyd and the others turned to walk away, Servin fired five shots from his car. Boyd was struck in the head and killed."Officer Servin's full actions resulted in termination charges and an unthinkable loss for a Chicago family," interim Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said in a statement.JUST WATCHED Chicago mayor: We must root out cancer of police abuse Replay More Videos ...
