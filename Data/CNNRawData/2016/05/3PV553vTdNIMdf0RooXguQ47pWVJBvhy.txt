(CNN) The feds are expected to announce a review of the North Charleston, South Carolina, police department Tuesday, according to a U.S. Justice Department news release.The mayor and police chief in the city of 100,000 requested the review, saying the scrutiny stemming from the police shooting of Walter Scott had made its efforts to protect residents while respecting their rights "more urgent and challenging.""Trust and communication are essential for improvement, and, as you can imagine, the death of Walter Scott damaged trust and made communication more difficult," the letter said.
