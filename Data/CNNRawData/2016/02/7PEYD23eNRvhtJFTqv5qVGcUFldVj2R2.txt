Story highlights Two Ohio EPA employees who work in the Sebring area office are on leave, a spokeswoman saysAgency: All 54 voluntary tap water samples in Sebring had allowable lead levels; an advisory is still in effect, thoughLawmakers have said the Ohio EPA knew about problems in August but didn't tell the public for months(CNN) The water in Sebring, Ohio -- one of several communities nationwide with worries about lead coming out of the tap -- appears to be getting better.But like in Flint, Michigan , the fallout from what's been happening in Sebring continues.The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency has put two employees from its field office that covers Sebring on administrative leave pending the results of an ongoing investigation, agency spokeswoman Heidi Griesmer said Thursday.The pair have been on leave since the start of last week, though Griesmer did not detail their positions or what they might have done wrong.A day earlier, her agency announced that tests of all 54 water samples (from 53 homes) came back showing "lead levels ... below the federal allowable limit." This is consistent with other recent tests indicating "improving water conditions" in the village of about 4,400 people between Canton and Youngstown.
