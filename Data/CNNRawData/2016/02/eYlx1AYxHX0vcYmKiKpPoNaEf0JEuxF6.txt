Story highlights Sides are arguing over access to confidential informationProsecution asked for delay to allow appeals court to rule(CNN) A judge in the court proceedings involving Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who has been charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, has issued a stay of proceedings, essentially putting the court martial on hold.The stay is in place until an appeals court can resolve a dispute involving the sharing of classified evidence with Bergdahl's defense team.Last week a military judge ordered the prosecution to provide defense attorneys with classified material, even evidence that hadn't been cleared by authorities who designate the classification for government documents.

Jeffrey Nance indicated in an email to the two sides.Read More
