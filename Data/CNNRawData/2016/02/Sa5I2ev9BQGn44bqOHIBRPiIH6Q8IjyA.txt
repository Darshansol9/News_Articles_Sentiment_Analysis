I can still see it."Authorities confirmed the shooter was an employee at Excel, but did not release a name or a motive.

He said the victims appear to have been randomly targeted.A witness identified as Dylan said he was unloading pallets in the back of the building at the time of the shooting."We heard a pop, pop, and we thought it was just metal falling on the ground, and then the doors opened, people started screaming, coming out," he told KSNW said.
