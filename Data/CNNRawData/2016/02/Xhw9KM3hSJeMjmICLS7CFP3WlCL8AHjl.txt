Story highlights Tests this week at the Indian Point nuclear facility show radioactivity levels in groundwater 65,000% higher than normalThe plant's owner says, "There is no health or safety consequence to the public"New York's governor says he is "deeply concerned," calls for investigation into the incident(CNN) A leak at the Indian Point nuclear facility in New York has sent contaminant into the area groundwater, causing radioactivity levels 65,000% higher than normal, the Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Saturday.The groundwater beneath the nuclear plant, which does not contribute to drinking water, flows into the Hudson River at a point about 25 miles north of New York City.Indian Point's parent company Entergy said elevated levels of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, had been detected in the groundwater at the facility, but that "there is no health or safety consequence to the public."The leak also does not pose a threat to the river environment because dilution would render the radioactive water "undetectable," said Neil Sheehan, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.On Saturday, Cuomo said he was "deeply concerned" by the leak and directed the heads of the state departments of health and environmental conservation to investigate.Read More
