Story highlights The Chemical Heritage Foundation has acquired one of Isaac Newton's handwritten manuscriptsNewton studied alchemy extensively; parts of alchemy were later rebranded as chemistry(CNN) Harry Potter wasn't the only one after the philosopher's stone.Isaac Newton's recently discovered manuscript is his handwritten copy of mid-17th-century Harvard alchemist George Starkey's procedure for producing "sophick mercury," a substance seen as a main ingredient for the philosopher's stone, a fabled stone used in alchemy.The document had been in private hands for most of the 20th century.
