The execution-style murders of eight members of the same family in rural Pike County, Ohio, has set residents on edge and sent investigators into overdrive as they try to find out who killed the Rhoden family members, and why.Adding to the intrigue: the discovery of marijuana growing operations at three of the four crime scenes.Here's what we know, and don't know, about the crimes:The killingsWhat we know:In a series of what investigators called well-planned, execution-style killings carried out at four locations, eight members of a single family were methodically shot in the head Friday while they slept in their homes about 50 miles south of Columbus.A relative discovered the bodies."There's blood all over the house," the woman told 911 operators. "My brother-in-law is in the bedroom. It looks like they beat the hell out of him."Authorities identified the victims as Hannah Gilley, 20; Christopher Rhoden Sr., 40; Christopher Rhoden Jr., 16; Clarence "Frankie" Rhoden, 20; Dana Rhoden, 37; Gary Rhoden, 38; Hanna Rhoden, 19; and Kenneth Rhoden, 44.Authorities in Ohio released this chart tracing the relationships of the slain Rhoden family members.Amid all the carnage, three children were found unharmed -- a 4-day-old infant who was next to her mother when she was killed, a 6-month-old baby and a 3-year-old. State authorities are now caring for the survivors.Two of the residences where the killings took place are within walking distance, authorities said. A third is about a mile away and the fourth about eight miles away, they said.What we don't know:Who killed them, or why. Authorities do, however, think the killers were familiar with the victims."It was a sophisticated operation and those who carried it out were trying to do everything they could do to hinder the investigation and their prosecution," Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said.JUST WATCHED 911 call: There is blood all over the house Replay More Videos ...
