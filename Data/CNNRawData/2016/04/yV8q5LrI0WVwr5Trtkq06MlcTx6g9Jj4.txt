So close in fact that he was often called the nation's first black president (before Barack Obama, of course). But on the campaign trail for his wife yesterday in Philadelphia, strains in the relationship were on full display. The ex-prez tangled with Black Lives Matters protesters for about 15 minutes. They criticized Hillary Clinton's use of the phrase "super predators" to describe black youth 20 years ago and 1990s-era crime and welfare bills. Someone shouted she was "a murderer." Bill Clinton vigorously defended his wife and said the protesters trying to shout him down were "afraid of the truth."2. Campaign 2016: GOPThings weren't much rosier on the Republican side of the trail yesterday. Earlier in the campaign, Ted Cruz seemed to anger most of New York -- one newspaper told him to take the "F U" train -- when he complained about "New York" values, prompting complaints from Mayor Bill de Blasio to GOP New York Rep. Peter King. Cruz campaigned in NYC yesterday, and, undeterred by the cool reception, made a pitch to the city's Jewish population, including making matzo at a Chabad in Brooklyn.JUST WATCHED New Yorkers on Ted Cruz and 'New York values' Replay More Videos ...
