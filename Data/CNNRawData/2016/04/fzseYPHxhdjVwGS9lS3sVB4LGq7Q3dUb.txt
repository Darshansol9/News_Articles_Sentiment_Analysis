(CNN) When a storm is moving in, sometimes you have to think fast.That's why cars in parts of Oklahoma and Texas were festooned Tuesday with blankets, couch cushions and even pool inflatables as armor against the threat of hail that passed through the region."This is serious business," WFAA-TV viewer Amber Barlow posted to the CNN affiliate's Facebook page, along with a photo. "I have toddler mattresses under the tarps over the windshield and back windows.

"No hail last night, feeling kinda stupid for strapping that mattress on top of my car," the Big Guy tweeted.No hail last night, feeling kinda stupid for strapping that mattress on top of my car â€” the Big Guy (@KRogers2) April 27, 2016Don't feel bad, Big Guy.
