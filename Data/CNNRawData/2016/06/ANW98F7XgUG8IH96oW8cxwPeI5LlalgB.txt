(CNN) For three months, two convicted killers were able to work almost nightly on cutting out of their prison cells, unnoticed, while simultaneously manipulating staff around them, according to a report released Monday that slams the prison from which the men escaped last summer.Richard Matt and David Sweat used prison workers at Clinton Correctional Facility and took advantage of an environment full of "systemic failures in management" in the months that led up to a prison break and manhunt that lasted three weeks in upstate New York, a New York Inspector General's report said.Matt and Sweat planned their escape for months. Sweat left his cell "nearly every night" in the three months that led up to the escape, the report said. He toiled away, cutting through brick, making his way into the tunnels before cutting into pipes that would lead him to a manhole in a neighborhood street, it said.Security staff failed to properly conduct 15 weekly scheduled cell inspections, including a March search of Matt's cell, which left an 18½ inch by 14½ inch hole in the rear wall of his cell unnoticed, according to the report."In the time Sweat was out of his cell over a three-month period, a total of more than 400 counts should have been conducted," the report found. "If only one of the counts was done properly, the escape plan would have been instantly stopped."Read More
