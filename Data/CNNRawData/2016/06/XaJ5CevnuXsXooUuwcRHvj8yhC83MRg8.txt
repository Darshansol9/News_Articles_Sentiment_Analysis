Story highlights The joke was on an Alabama teen who tried to prank her friendsFirefighters were involved in taking the mask off(CNN) Have a Barney costume lying around? Think twice before you put it on.Alabama teenager Darby Risner was trying to pull a prank by wearing the big purple dinosaur costume when the massive mask got stuck on her head and shoulders. Her friends tried to help her out, but only exacerbated the situation by pulling her in both directions -- and of course, being the teenagers they are, they took a video and posted it on Twitter.When the group was unsuccessful in helping to free Risner, they had to go with her to the fire station where firefighters removed the Barney mask. Sounds easy enough, right? Nope, it took 45 minutes. And needless to say, that was also captured on social media.Darby got stuck in a Barney head pic.twitter.com/oTkoDEsiay â€” Logan Risner (@loganrisner1919) June 21, 2016"When she first got there, we looked at it and it was tight," Lt. Vince Bruno of Trussville Fire and Rescue told CNN affiliate WVTM . "It had come down around her shoulders and was holding her arms, which looked kind of like dinosaur arms because she could bend from the elbows down, and it was little comical."No word on whether she sang the classic "I love you, you love me," but it's probably safe to say that she won't try that stunt again.
