(CNN) A Connecticut teen-ager was sentenced Monday to 25 years in prison for fatally stabbing a classmate in a high school stairwell on the morning of their junior prom two years ago.Christopher Plaskon, 19, had pleaded no contest in March to murder charges in the death of 16-year-old Maren Sanchez. Prosecutors said Plaskon stabbed Sanchez because she turned down his prom invitation, but Plaskon's lawyers disputed that account.A no contest plea means the accused does not admit guilt but agrees not to dispute the charges.The attack occurred about 7 a.m. on April 25, 2014, at Jonathan Law High School in Milford. A witness saw Plaskon on top of Sanchez and tried unsuccessfully to pull him off, according to the probable cause statement. Another witness said they saw him discard a bloody knife in a school corridor.Sanchez, described by her family as "a bright light full of hopes and dreams," was cut in her neck, chest and face. Plaskon was taken into custody the same day. Students were sent home, and the prom was postponed.Read More
