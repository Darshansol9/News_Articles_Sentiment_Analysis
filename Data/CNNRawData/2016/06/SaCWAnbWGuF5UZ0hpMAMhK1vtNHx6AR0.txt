(CNN) Fresh memories of a mass shooting in a gay nightclub loomed large over LGBT pride celebrations nationwide Sunday, two weeks to the day after a gunman killed 49 people in Florida.Millions gathered in major American cities for annual celebrations of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities.This time last year, parade-goers celebrated a major milestone with the nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage.This year, heightened security measures and tributes to the 49 victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando marked celebrations.Despite the somber undercurrent, the spirit of jubilation prevailed throughout pride events, embodied by the multi-generational crowds awash in rainbows.Even if the tone of events was muted, supporters said they took on a special meaning."I think it is an act of defiance on one level, to come out and say, 'We stand by our values: inclusion and love and tolerance,' " New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio told CNN on Sunday."There's a somber feeling obviously, and there's pain over what happened in Orlando, but the answer is not to run and hide. The answer is to stand up boldly, and that's what New York City is doing today."Extra securityWith the shooting in mind, law enforcement agencies across the country took additional steps to ensure security.More than 20,000 people were expected to participate in New York's pride celebration, including Hillary Clinton .

I was astonished; we stretched out as far as I could see, thousands of us," one of the marchers, Fred Sargeant, told the Village Voice decades later. "There were no floats, no music, no boys in briefs. The cops turned their backs on us to convey their disdain, but the masses of people kept carrying signs and banners, chanting and waving to surprised onlookers."
