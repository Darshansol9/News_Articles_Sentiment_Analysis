"I was just pelted in the face with sand and I actually have sand in my contact right now. It kind of hurts."Beachgoers endure high winds and flying sand on Labor Day weekend at Atlantic City.Masbahul Islam, a pedicab driver who has worked in Atlantic City for six years, said the Labor Day crowd is much smaller than in years past.

Hermine will once again have hurricane-force winds again Sunday, though it is classified as a post-tropical cyclone.Storm surge could be 3 to 5 feet above the ground during high tide in areas from northeastern Virginia to New Jersey through the weekend."At a minimum, we're going to have some beach erosion, rip currents and dangerous waves all the way from the south facing shores of New England, Cape Cod, Nantucket ... down to the Hampton Roads area," Knabb said.New Jersey Gov.

"This situation may become too large in scope to be handled by the normal county and municipal operating services."The National Weather Service said some minor flooding could begin Saturday during high tide. But that will be just the beginning of the trouble."Widespread moderate to major flooding is now expected with the Sunday evening high tide and the Monday morning high tide, especially from Atlantic City south to coastal Delaware, when the storm is expected to make its closest approach to the area," the weather service said, adding that significant beach erosion is forecast.The good news is rainfall in New Jersey and Delaware is expected to be only between 1 and 3 inches.Winds like a hurricaneHermine could reach wind speeds of 75 mph as it strengthens Sunday, forecasters say."That strengthening could impact places from Nantucket, Cape Cod, New York City, even up and down the New Jersey coast," said CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar."The combination of a storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. There is a danger of life-threatening inundation during the next 24 hours in the Hampton Roads area," the Hurricane Center said Saturday evening."There is also the possibility of life-threatening inundation during the next 48 hours at many coastal locations between Sandy Hook, New Jersey, and Bridgeport, Connecticut," the Saturday evening advisory reads.Labor Day cancellationsBecause of concerns about rough seas, dangerous surf and strong storm surge, no swimming will be allowed on New York beaches Sunday. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city is considering closing them Monday and Tuesday, too."We'll see how the storm develops. People can walk on the beach and be on the sand, just not in the water," he said.Photos: Hermine storms into Florida Eli White covers his face from the blowing sand in Nags Head, North Carolina, Saturday, September 3, as the tail of Tropical Storm Hermine passes the Outer Banks.
