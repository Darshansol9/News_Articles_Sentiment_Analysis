A service also was held at the Flight 93 National Memorial.After the September 11 commemoration ceremony, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo joined more than 450 motorcycle riders participating in the 9/11 Memorial Motorcycle Ride at a lunch in New York City. The ride pays tribute to the strength, courage and heroism of the first responders who led recovery efforts during and following the terrorist attacks.On Sunday, the NFL and Major League Baseball were to commemorate 9/11 with appearances by military personnel and first responders and the unfurling of giant flags. The ceremonies come amid a heated debate ignited last month when San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the anthem in protest of racial injustice in America.The NFL was bracing for player demonstrations during the national anthem at Sunday opening-week games after other players vowed to follow Kaepernick's lead.At the Pentagon, Obama praised an America "drawn from every corner of the world, every color, every religion, every background.""Our patchwork heritage is not a weakness," he said. "It is still and always will be one of our greatest strengths. This is the America that was attacked that September morning. This is the America that we must remain true to."
