A glitch on our part sent the newsletter to your inboxes not at 6 a.m. but at noon yesterday. Embarrassing! It's all good now. And here are 5 things you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door .1. Italy earthquakeThe ground won't stop shaking in central Italy where aftershocks are rattling residents and making rescue work difficult in the earthquake-ravaged towns. The death toll is now 267 - and rising with each passing hour, as more bodies are dug out from the rubble. But then come the aftershocks, sending everyone scurrying for cover and raining more debris. And the work begins anew2. Nuns killedSomeone stabbed to death two nuns who spent their whole lives helping the poor. The nuns helped run a clinic in Lexington, Mississippi, and were much loved by doctors and residents.

November can't come fast enough.4. Migrant crisisMake some time and read this one story today . It's an intimate look at the perilous journey migrants take from North Africa across the Mediterranean. CNN's Moni Basu beautifully tells the story through two characters: John Hamilton, the captain of a search-and-rescue vessel, who looks for these overcrowded boats; and Mogahid Sabeel, who fled Darfur and hopes to put his college degree to use in Europe.5. Ryan LochteThought Lochtegate was over? Well, that wouldn't be much fun, now would it? Rio cops have now charged him with falsely reporting a crime for his "I was robbed at gunpoint" fib. If convicted, he'll pay a fine or be Lochte-up. (Sorry, we couldn't resist). There will be no negotiations , Rio says.BREAKFAST BROWSEPeople are talking about these. Read up.
