Story highlights September 2015 incident, fueled by social media, spurred widespread outrageThe suit was filed by Ahmed's dad in federal court in Texas(CNN) A federal lawsuit has been filed on behalf of Ahmed Mohamed, the Muslim teen who was detained and hauled off in handcuffs last year because authorities thought a handmade clock he brought to his Texas high school to show his teachers was a bomb.The lawsuit, filed Monday by Ahmed's father, Mohamed Elhassen Mohamed, maintains that Ahmed's civil rights were violated by the Irving Independent School District, MacArthur High School Principal Daniel Cummings and the city of Irving, near Dallas.The suit said Ahmed's rights were "violated in contravention of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments" of the U.S. Constitution. It cites "a clear pattern of discrimination based upon race as well as discrimination based upon religion" in the school district.The suit also says the state of Texas, including the school district, "has a history of discrimination against Muslims in Texas curriculum and schools."The incident took place in September. One of Ahmed's teachers thought the clock was a bomb and contacted school authorities, who then called police. The boy, then 14, was detained, questioned and taken away in handcuffs. He was later released to his parents and not charged, although his school suspended him for three days.JUST WATCHED Ahmed Mohamed receives job offers, White House invite Replay More Videos ...
