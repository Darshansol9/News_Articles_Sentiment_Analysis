Last night protesters fired shots and threw objects. One person was shot and hospitalized; a police officer was also injured when a rock broke the windshield of a squad car. Sylville Smith was killed Saturday, triggering hours of unrest that included the torching of six businesses.2. Louisiana floodingIt was a weekend of wet misery in Louisiana -- five dead and more than 7,000 rescued from their homes in massive flooding in the state . Tens of thousands have been evacuated.

The video of some of the missing Chibok girls was released yesterday by Boko Haram. The 11-minute-long clip features a masked militant holding a rifle and speaking in front of about 50 girls. The terrorists demand Nigeria release jailed Boko Haram fighters; the government said it's working for the release of the girls, who were kidnapped more than two years ago.5.
