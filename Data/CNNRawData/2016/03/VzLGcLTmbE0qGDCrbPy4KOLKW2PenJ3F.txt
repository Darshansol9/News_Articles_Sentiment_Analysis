Story highlights Feds find Newark police violated citizens' constitutional rightsNewark mayor says city looks forward to improving police practices(CNN) The Justice Department and the city of Newark have reached a settlement after a yearslong investigation into the Newark Police Department's practices, according to an announcement Wednesday.Investigators found that NPD officers were violating citizens' rights under the First, Fourth and 14th amendments to the Constitution by engaging in illegal stops, searches, arrests, use of excessive force and theft by officers.
