Story highlights Akai Gurley's aunt calls recommendation an "added injustice done to Akai and our family"Prosecutor recommends house arrest, no jail time, in police shootingA jury found Peter Liang guilty of manslaughter and official misconduct in Gurley's 2014 death(CNN) A New York prosecutor has recommended six months of house arrest but no jail time for a former police officer convicted of fatally shooting an unarmed man in a housing project.Liang was immediately fired after the highly unusual conviction of a cop for the shooting death of a civilian. He faces a prison term of up to 15 years at sentencing next month.But Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson has recommended a sentence of five years of probation, including six months of home confinement with electronic monitoring and 500 hours of community service."Mr. Liang has no prior criminal history and poses no future threat to public safety," Thompson said in a statement Wednesday. "Because his incarceration is not necessary to protect the public, and due to the unique circumstances of this case, a prison sentence is not warranted."
