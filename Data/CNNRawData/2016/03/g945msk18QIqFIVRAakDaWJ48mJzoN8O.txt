(CNN) A teenager who authorities say impersonated a doctor has been arrested again and now faces charges of fraud and larceny.Authorities say Love-Robinson used the checking account information from one of his clients to pay off more than $34,000 in car payments.He appeared before a judge Wednesday and was ordered to undergo a mental examination. The teen was granted supervised released.CNN attempted to contact Love-Robinson's attorney, Andrew Stine, for comment.Despite the new charges, Stine spoke highly of his client in an interview with CNN affiliate WPTV"He has the entrepreneurial spirit of someone like a Donald Trump or a Bill Gates. I've never met somebody -- and I'm much older obviously -- who has such entrepreneurial spirit," Stine said. "If it was channeled maybe in a different direction things could be different here today."Love-Robinson was charged last month by authorities with practicing medicine without a license.He has denied the claims."I'm not portraying as an M.D. I never said I've gone to school to be an M.D.," he told ABC News.Authorities in Florida carried out an operation in which an undercover officer visited Love-Robinson's office, according to a statement from the sheriff's office.Love-Robinson physically examined the officer and provided medical advice, said the statement, which detailed a nearly two-week investigation that culminated in his arrest.As police led Love-Robinson out of his office in handcuffs, he said, "I'm hurt because of the accusations and allegations. But like I said, this is not the first time where I've been accused and I will pursue this. And when I do, you guys will know," according to WPBF.The website for Love-Robinson's practice lists the teen as its president, CEO and founder. It refers to Love-Robinson as "Dr." and places acronyms after his name, including Ph.D. and HHP-C, which is used for those involved in home health and personal care. A Ph.D. is generally not a medical degree.
