A contractor delivering feed to the herd discovered the dead animals.Lund said wildlife officials are concerned because wolves usually eat what they kill or come back later to feed.The pack suspected of killing the elks has nine wolves, he added.There are about 1,100 elk in the area, he said, and about 7% of the population has been lost to wolves this winter.
