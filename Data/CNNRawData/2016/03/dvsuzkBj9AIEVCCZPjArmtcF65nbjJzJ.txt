Two of the three also pleaded not guilty to charges of falsely reporting the incident.The charges against the women come weeks after the upstate New York university held a rally in support of the African-American students, who said they were attacked by a group of white men and women during a confrontation on a bus January 30.But the university police department said last week that a three-week investigation found the three women actually assaulted a 19-year-old female passenger in the incident, were not subjected to racial epithets and falsely reported the alleged crime."The evidence shows that, contrary to how the defendants originally portrayed things, these three individuals were not the victims of a crime," university Police Chief Frank Wiley said in a statement prior to the arraignment. "Rather, we allege that they are the perpetrators."Ariel Agudio, 20, faces charges of assault in the third degree, falsely reporting an incident in the third degree, attempted assault in the third degree, harassment in the second degree and attempted criminal mischief in the fourth degree; Alexis Briggs, 20, faces a count of assault in the third degree; and Asha Burwell, 20, faces charges of assault in the third degree, harassment in the second degree and falsely reporting an incident in the third degree.Read More
