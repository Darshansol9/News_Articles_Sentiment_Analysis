The center has three barns total and more than 100 horses.The barn had already collapsed when firefighters arrived, according to Reed. He also said it took fire crews more than 30 minutes to arrive."While we were waiting, we were in the barn, running in the flames and smoke, saving horses," Reed told CNN.
