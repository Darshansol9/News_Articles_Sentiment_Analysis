(CNN) In his nearly eight years in office, President Obama has formally addressed the nation on the subject of gun violence 25 times: on average, every 112 days.But in the last year alone, he has made such statements roughly every 36 days.In October 2015, after a gunman opened fire at Oregon's Umpqua Community College, killing nine people and injuring seven, a visibly upset Obama said the shootings were becoming all too routine.He then asked news organizations to tally the number of Americans killed through terrorist attacks in the last decade and compare it with the number of Americans who have died in gun violence.CNN tallied those numbers last year, and with another year of data available now, we have updated our findings.
