Please tag #CNNiReport in your message.(CNN) The National Weather Service is not mincing words about powerful Hurricane Matthew.The agency's Melbourne, Florida, office warned Thursday night that homes and buildings in central Florida "may be uninhabitable for weeks or months."The dire warning is similar to one sent just before Hurricane Katrina plowed into the Gulf Coast in 2005, CNN Senior Meteorologist Dave Hennen said."Extremely dangerous, life-threatening weather conditions are forecast in the next 12 to 24 hours," the weather service warned. Forecasters predict storm surge is some areas could be as high as 11 feet and as many as 15 inches of rain could fall.The effects of the storm will be unlike any hurricane in decades, the weather service said.The caution came as Matthew's outer bands raked the Florida peninsula and the eye of the storm moved closer to the state's east coast.Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who spent the better part of the past three days warning residents to evacuate ahead of the Category 4 hurricane, told them Thursday night that the storm is a "monster.""You still have time to leave. Get out. There's no reason to take a chance," he said.Many left coastal areas, but many stayed, anxious to see how their area would stand up to the storm.Here's what you need to know:• Matthew remains a Category 4 storm with winds of 130 mph, according to the latest National Hurricane Center advisory. As of 11 p.m. ET, Matthew was about 125 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral. The center of the storm was moving northwest at 13 mph.Want to see what.were talking about when we say another "band of rain and wind has arrived?" #HurricaneMatthew is here pic.twitter.com/bMGbR0GOLF — Sara Sidner (@sarasidnerCNN) October 7, 2016• Roughly 26 million people live in areas that are under a hurricane or tropical storm warning or watch, and the hurricane will likely cause billions of dollars in damage, CNN Weather's Dave Hennen said. The National Weather Service warned that some places could be uninhabitable for "weeks or months."• The storm has killed at least 269 people in three Caribbean countries. The majority, 264 people, died in Haiti, said Civil Protection Service spokesman Joseph Edgard Celestin.• Based on the latest projections , Matthew could make landfall in Florida as a Category 4 storm, or it could skirt the coast and head north before possibly heading back toward land.JUST WATCHED Rick Scott: Hurricane Matthew will kill people Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Rick Scott: Hurricane Matthew will kill people 00:48Florida braces for direct hitScott told Floridians on the state's Atlantic coast that the question is not whether they will lose power, but for how long. More than 95,000 customers were without power throughout the state, according to the governor.A direct hit by Matthew, he said, could lead to "massive destruction" on a level unseen since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Voluntary and mandatory evacuations in the state stretch from Miami to the Florida-Georgia border.At least two counties are under curfew until 7 a.m. Saturday, officials announced. Orange and Volusia Counties on Thursday night instituted mandatory curfews. The curfews include Orlando and Daytona Beach.People who stayed behind stocked up on supplies and boarded up windows, as there were numerous reports of county governments, schools, cruise lines and amusement parks closing. Many residents found long gas lines. But so far, the state isn't running short on supplies, Scott said.Daytona Beach residents fill sandbags Thursday.Airline passengers were urged to call before leaving for the airport. Florida airports had canceled hundreds of flights, most of them in Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Orlando. Fort Lauderdale closed its airport, airlines suspended operations in Miami, and Orlando's airport was slated to close at 8 p.m. Thursday, airport officials said.Palm Beach residents cleared many grocery store shelves ahead of the storm. Yet despite all the warnings, West Palm Beach Mayor Jeri Muoio said not everyone is listening, even with mandatory evacuation orders in place."More people are staying than leaving. It's very concerning. When the winds really pick up, we will not be sending (emergency responders) out," she said.#HurricaneMatthew fast approaching West Palm Beach, weather has started to take a turn just after 1:15pET pic.twitter.com/d1t1zFp2d9 — Nick Valencia (@CNNValencia) October 6, 2016With the eye of Hurricane Matthew pushing north, Miami-Dade County will restart some services, including public transit, on Friday morning, Mayor Carlos A.

In fact, a sign outside declares his bar open: "Honk for hurricane party inside."Boarding up but staying put. Daniel Myara of Cruisin' Cafe says he'll stay open.

"I'm not worried; I am being realistic... I live in a solid concrete condo. I'm pretty secure."Mandatory evacuations in South CarolinaCars packed highways in South Carolina, where officials gave mandatory evacuation orders for several counties.Close to half a million people were expected to have evacuated by Thursday, said Kim Stenson, director of South Carolina Emergency Management.Photos: Hurricane Matthew's path of destruction Photos: Hurricane Matthew's path of destruction People wade through floodwaters with a boat in Nichols, South Carolina, on Monday, October 10.
