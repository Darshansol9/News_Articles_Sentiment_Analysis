(CNN) A Maryland appeals court judge ruled Friday that Baltimore police Officer William Porter doesn't need to testify -- at least for now -- in the trial of Officer Caesar Goodson. Both officers were charged in the death of Freddie Gray. Judge Peter Krauser's order is temporary, until a final decision is made on Porter's appeal of an earlier motion that he must testify in Goodson's trial.
