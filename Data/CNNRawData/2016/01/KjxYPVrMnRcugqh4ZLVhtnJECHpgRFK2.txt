Story highlights Officer Peter Liang is charged with manslaughterProsecutors accuse him of recklessly firing the shot that killed Akai GurleyThe rookie officer's attorney says his gun accidentally dischargedNew York (CNN) Peter Liang, the police officer who shot Akai Gurley in the stairwell of a New York housing project, was more concerned about saving his own job than saving the man's life, a prosecutor argued.Speaking in his opening statement in the manslaughter trial of Liang, the prosecutor accused the rookie New York Police officer of recklessly shooting into a dark stairwell "for no reason" that night in November 2014"Then, instead of doing all that he could to help Akai Gurley, he wasted precious time arguing with his partner about calling for help," Assistant District Attorney Marc Fliedner told jurors. "In fact, instead of calling for help, he just stood there and whined and moaned about how he would get fired."Gurley was shot in the chest and later died at the hospital. The next day, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton told reporters the 28-year-old was "a total innocent" who fell victim to "a very unfortunate tragedy ... involving an accidental discharge."JUST WATCHED Police: Cop fatally shot 'innocent' man Replay More Videos ...
