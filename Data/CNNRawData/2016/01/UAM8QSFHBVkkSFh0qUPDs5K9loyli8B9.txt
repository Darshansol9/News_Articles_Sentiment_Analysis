You may recognize the name " Covenant House " from the group's national "Sleep Out" movement, in which fundraisers sleep outside to raise awareness about homeless youth. According to the most recent U.S. Department of Education count , nearly 2.5 million children experienced homelessness in 2013. Covenant House provides a safe haven for at-risk and homeless teens, and the group has teamed up with the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia to give young homeless people coping mechanisms to deal with the stress of their situation, including meditation and tai chi.
