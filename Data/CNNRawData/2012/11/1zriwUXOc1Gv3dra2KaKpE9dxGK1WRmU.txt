Turkey then transferred him to Tunisia, where he is being held."We are very pleased the Tunisian government is working with American investigators to allow in person access to Ali Ani al Harzi. Under this arrangement the interviews will be under Tunisian supervision and consistent with their sovereignty and meets the needs of our investigative team," U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham and Saxby Chambliss said in a statement Saturday."Allowing American investigators in person access will make the interview more meaningful and is a welcome breakthrough in our efforts to find the perpetrators of the Benghazi Consulate attacks," they added.According to the government official, al Harzi is not the only suspect federal agents are looking at."We're continuing to look at any and all leads," the official said, declining to say how many others are under investigation.
