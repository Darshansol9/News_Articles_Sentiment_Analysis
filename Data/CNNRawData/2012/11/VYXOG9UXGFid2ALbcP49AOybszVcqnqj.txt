(CNN) -- Kevin Cordova's family tried cooking hot food to stay warm. They wore their winter coats inside and buried themselves under blankets.But on Sunday, six days after powerful winds from Superstorm Sandy knocked out their power, temperatures dipped so low they couldn't spend another night in their home in Floral Park, New York."There's really no amount of blankets that can stop you from being cold in 30-degree weather," said Cordova, 28. "We feel a little homeless right now. We have our house, but we can't really use it."Officials say thousands of New Yorkers left without heat after Superstorm Sandy might need to leave their homes as temperatures plummet, but it's not clear where they'll go.How you can help people recoverBetween 30,000 and 40,000 people in New York City could need housing, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Sunday. Officials are working on coming up with a solution, he said, but they haven't yet."We don't have a lot of empty housing in this city," he said. "We are not going to let anybody go sleeping in the streets. We're not going to let anybody go without blankets, food and water, but it's a challenge and we're working on that."New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo described it as a "massive housing problem."The storm that broke records -- and hearts"People are in homes that are uninhabitable," Cuomo told reporters.

The freelance editor said his family was grateful their house survived the storm, but they're unsure of what to do if their power stays out much longer. On Sunday night, his family planned to stay with friends."We're all staying in different houses," he said, "but I don't know how long we can keep that up."More than 10,000 people across nine states spent Saturday night in shelters, American Red Cross spokeswoman Attie Poirier said. The Red Cross is sending 80,000 blankets to the region ahead of colder weather predicted this week."As we move through energy and gasoline, housing is really the No. 1 concern," said Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who spoke in Hoboken, New Jersey.Live blog: Aftermath of Sandy"And we don't even know yet which of the houses are reparable and which are irreparable losses.

"It was the same temperature inside the apartment as it was outside."Munn, 25, who stayed at her parents' house, got word that her power came back Sunday.But many others were still in limbo."People aren't leaving their homes," said Staten Island resident Tara Saylor, 25.

Chris Christie, who urged patience."I know it stinks. I still don't have power at my house.

Once approved, the voter will be sent an electronic ballot that can, in turn, be e-mailed or faxed back to the county clerk.Long gas lines test patienceThe 900-mile-wide superstorm left a huge swath of damage when it hit the Northeast last week, claiming at least 110 lives in the United States and two in Canada after earlier killing 67 around the Caribbean.Worst-hit New York state suffered 47 deaths, including 40 in New York City, authorities said.
