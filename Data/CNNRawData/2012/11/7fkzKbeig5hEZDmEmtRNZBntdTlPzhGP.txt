John Allen while commanding troops in Iraq describes his ability to inspire the loyalty.A mortar shell landed near a mess hall where Allen was eating, sending a young soldier under the table for cover. Allen, who remained upright during the attack, bent over and said to him, "Son, you're not going to win the war from down there."Allen may be tempted to find cover under a mess hall table this week as he has been entangled in the sex scandal that ended the career of Gen. David Petraeus, who he followed as commander of international troops in Afghanistan.An investigation into "flirtatious" e-mail exchanges between Allen and Jill Kelley , the woman whose complaint about anonymous, harassing e-mails uncovered Patraeus' affair with Paula Broadwell , has put Allen's promotion as NATO commander on hold.The married father of two daughters did not have an affair with Kelley, who is also married, according to a senior official close to the general."Allen has never been alone with her," the official said. "He does everything with his wife."Allen, who has a habit of replying to every e-mail he gets, never wrote about sex although he may have said "thanks sweetheart," in casual e-mail conversation, the official said.JUST WATCHED Marks: 'Bizarre' communication for Allen Replay More Videos ...
