by George Howell, CNN(CNN) -- Nearly two months since the hazing death of Florida A&M University drum major Robert Champion, the school's board of trustees voted Monday to approve a three-part plan to tackle the issue of hazing on campus.The strategy, devised by the public relations firm hired by FAMU in December, Dan Klores Communications, includes creating a memorial on campus for Champion, setting up a scholarship in the deceased drum major's name and organizing an independent blue-ribbon panel of experts to examine hazing.Trustee Belinda Reed Shannon proposed the measures during a scheduled monthly conference call with fellow board members, and said she would lead the task of selecting the panel of five experts, with backgrounds in law, academia, public policy, psychology and band organizations.
