Story highlights Demonstrators gather outside of Alfafa Dinner for high-level dignitariesThe group attempts to create a human blockade as guests arriveSome attendees, including Joe Lieberman, are doused with glitterOccupy DC protesters gathered to demonstrate Saturday outside the 99th annual Alfalfa Club dinner thrown for high-level dignitaries, including President Obama.The protesters marched from one of their downtown Washington home bases to the nearby Capital Hilton hotel, where the dinner was held.Marching through the streets, the demonstrators chanted "Whose streets? Our streets!" and "We are the 99%," until they reached barricades outside of the hotel. Once at the barricades, protesters continued to chant and attempted to create a human blockade to hamper the guests from entering the dinner.The Alfalfa Club is an organization comprised of Washington VIPs such as congressmen and business executives whom Occupy DC activists say personify the "1%" members of the movement have been rallying against since last year.As guests arrived, they were forced to pass through the barricade and Occupy DC protesters. While police assisted them passing through, protesters continued to chant and started to throw glitter on the attendees. Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, and the other guests accompanying him were among those who were doused with the glitter."I am out here today dressed up as myself; middle-class, middle-aged PTA parent to show that the 99% includes regular people like me," Occupy DC protester Eric Lotke told CNN. "What we need to do is start listening to the people, and if we listen to the people, they want the clean energy, they want the money out of politics, they want the health care, they want these things and they can't get them because there's a ruling class that wants things to be done differently."The Occupy Wall Street movement began in New York in September and has spread across major cities worldwide as a call to action against what protesters consider the unequal distribution of wealth.Saturday's protest comes just two days before the National Park Service is slated to end overnight camping at the Occupy DC sites.Also Saturday, protesters clashed with police in Oakland, California, resulting in at least 19 arrests.
