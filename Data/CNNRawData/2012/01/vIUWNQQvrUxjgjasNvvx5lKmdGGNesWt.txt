Officials at the college also could not be reached.Gann's announcement was first reported by the Forum, the college's student news publication."We have engaged outside legal counsel to review our admission-related data processes and are committed to strengthening them to ensure that this type of conduct will not occur in the future," the college said in a statement.Claremont McKenna College is one of seven institutions that comprise The Claremont Colleges.
