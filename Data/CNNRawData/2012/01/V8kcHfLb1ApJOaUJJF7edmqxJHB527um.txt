The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration sought the order."Safety is our highest priority," Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement. "We will not tolerate irresponsible bus companies that jeopardize the safety of bus passengers and other motorists."A bus company official could not be reached for comment.Over the past five years, the safety agency has doubled the number of bus inspections and comprehensive safety reviews of the nation's estimated 4,000 passenger bus companies, according to the DOT.
