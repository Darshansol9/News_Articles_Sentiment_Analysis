(CNN) -- Although GLAAD probably would have preferred that ABC's new comedy "Work It" had never made it to air at all, the network has canceled the comedy after just two episodes, reports the New York Times.Even ahead of its premiere, the sitcom, which focused on two men who dress as women in a last-ditch attempt to find work in a difficult economy, was met with negative reactions. Aside from looking like a knock-off of "Bosom Buddies," organizations such as GLAAD didn't find the premise funny."During a period in which the transgender community now routinely finds itself in the cultural crosshairs, the timing couldn't be worse for a show based on the notion that men dressed as women is inherently funny," the organization said in a blog post on its site before "Work It" premiered.
