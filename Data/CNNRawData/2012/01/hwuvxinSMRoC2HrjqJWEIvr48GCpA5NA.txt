By Madison Park, CNN(CNN) -- School meals will have to offer fruits and vegetables to students every day under standards issued by the United States Department of Agriculture on Wednesday.The meal programs, which feed about 32 million students in public and private schools, will have to reduce sodium, saturated fat and trans fats. Schools must also offer more whole grains as well as fat-free or low-fat milk varieties.These standards go into effect July 1 and will be phased in over a three-year period, according to the USDA.The new nutrition standards are largely based on recommendations by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, as part of efforts to curb childhood obesity. Recent numbers show that about 17% of children in the United States are obese.
