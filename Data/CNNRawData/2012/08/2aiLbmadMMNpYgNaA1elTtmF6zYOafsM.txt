A telephone number for the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children will also be on the decal of the two Toyotas, said BK Racing , which owns both cars."Being from Iowa, and having some other folks in the sport from Iowa, we're all pulling together to raise as much attention as possible to help locate the two missing girls," said Landon Cassil of Cedar Rapids and driver of No. 83 . "I really want to do as much as possible and this is one step."Travis Kvapil, who drives No. 93, is a father of three and hopes the team's efforts will aid in the search."As a parent, I want to do anything I can to help the families locate their children," he said.Lyric and Elizabeth were last seen by their grandmother on July 13. Authorities investigating their disappearance believe they are still alive."We believe these girls are alive and we are not discouraged by the passage of time since their disappearance," FBI spokeswoman Sandy Breault told reporters in Evansdale, Iowa, last month.She declined to discuss exactly what evidence investigators might have that pushed them toward that conclusion. Breault said she believes someone knows something, and she urged anyone with information to step forward.JUST WATCHED Missing Iowa girl's grandma: not family Replay More Videos ...

Unfortunately, in this case law enforcement has not received total cooperation from all family and close friends. It's important to note that the majority of the family has cooperated 100%," Breault said.
