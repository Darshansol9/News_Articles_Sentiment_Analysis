Story highlights Canadian fisherman were stopping trucks hauling cheap Maine lobster into plantsFishermen forced mass shipments of lobster back to MaineSnowe called the injunction "welcome news for Maine's hardworking lobstermen"Unseasonably warm winter resulted in abundance of Maine lobster, causing price dropUnusually high catches of Maine lobster have boiled up into demonstrations this week in Canada, where protesters, largely comprised of Canadian fishermen, were hit with a temporary court injunction Thursday that required them to stay away from processing plants.The group had been seeking to prevent trucks from hauling Maine lobster into Canadian plants because of an excess of the crustacean, which has contributed to a recent crash in wholesale prices."We are hopeful that this will allow companies to resume processing and ensure operations won't be interrupted," said Anne McInerney, a New Brunswick provincial spokesman.Protesters are required to stay at least 200 feet away from the entrance and may have only six pickets on site at a time, she said.Fishermen had blocked trucks, sending mass shipments of lobster back to Maine, according to a spokesman for Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe.Thursday's injunction was "welcome news for Maine's hardworking lobstermen and truckers," Snowe said.JUST WATCHED 17-lb. lobster freed from dinner table Replay More Videos ...

"We have never seen anything like it. The price has not budged. If it doesn't come up soon, it's going to be a long winter."New England retailers have since been offering deals in hopes of boosting sales and increasing demand.
