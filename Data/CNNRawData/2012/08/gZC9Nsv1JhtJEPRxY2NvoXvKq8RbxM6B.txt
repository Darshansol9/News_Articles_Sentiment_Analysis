Some protesters wore bright colored balaclava resembling a ski mask similar to the ones worn by the female rockers.This is one of the many protests Amnesty International will hold until the women are freed, said Andrea Collins, a DC artist and Amnesty coalition partner.In Collins' speech before the show, she compared the band's group members, Nadezhda, Maria Alyokhina and Yekaterina to "the young 20 something's of DC.""They are just like you and Pussy Riot would be here protesting for other bands," Collins said.Dave Lesser, lead singer of the band Brenda, pledged to wear his face mask at every protest until the band is free.He said he hopes the Russian government notices how much attention this case is getting worldwide. Facing jail time for voicing your opinion is ridiculous, he said.Pussy Riot faces trial in the coming week for playing an impromptu concert in the Christ the Savior Cathedral in Moscow and for criticizing the Russian president.
