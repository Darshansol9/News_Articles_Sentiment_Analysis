"We are a family-owned business, a family-led business, and we are married to our first wives. We give God thanks for that."On a Facebook page Huckabee created announcing the event, more than 620,000 people said they would participate."The goal is simple: Let's affirm a business that operates on Christian principles and whose executives are willing to take a stand for the godly values we espouse by simply showing up and eating at Chick Fil-A on Wednesday, August 1," wrote Huckabee, a former pastor.Lines snaked around a Chick-fil-A in Dallas, CNN affiliate WFAA reported.

Political leaders who have criticized the chain, like the mayors of Boston and Chicago, are hypocritical, he said."I think it is ironic that the so-called forces of tolerance and inclusion are calling for the exclusion of Chick-fil-A from cities simply because of the beliefs of their chairman. ... People that disagree with me have a right to their opinion, and I have a right to mine," he said.In Oklahoma, Tim Tibbles told iReport that many braved hot weather to show their support for the restaurant."It's 109 degrees here, and people have been standing outside for well over an hour.

Some Wendy's franchises in North and South Carolina weighed in Wednesday morning with signs outside their restaurants saying, "We Stand With Chick-fil-A.""Too often, those on the left make corporate statements to show support for same-sex marriage, abortion, or profanity, but if Christians affirm traditional values, we're considered homophobic, fundamentalists, hate-mongers, and intolerant," Huckabee said on the Facebook page, adding that neither the company nor the Cathy family was involved in proposing or promoting the event.A vice president of the company said the day was not created by Chick-fil-A."We appreciate all of our customers and are glad to serve them at any time," Steve Robinson said in a statement. "Our goal is simple: to provide great food, genuine hospitality and to have a positive influence on all who come into contact with Chick-fil-A."He declined to comment on sales figures or volume, saying Chick-fil-A is a privately held company.Proponents of same-sex marriage organized a simple counterprotest for Wednesday, asking people to donate the approximate cost of a Chick-fil-A meal, about $6.50, to gay and lesbian rights groups, according to the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, known as GLAAD.The organization is backing a "National Same-Sex Kiss Day" to be held Friday at Chick-fil-A restaurants nationwide, encouraging participants to post photos to the Internet.
