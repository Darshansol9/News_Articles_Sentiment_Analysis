By John Martin, CNN(CNN)--Rebekah Lester will be Duette Elementary school's new teacher this school year. With only one teacher, Duette is the last school of its kind in Florida."You could call it a one-room schoolhouse but essentially the students are in one room with one teacher," Lester told CNN affiliate WTSP . The elementary school serves 18 students from kindergarten through sixth grade.The building, which was built in 1930 by volunteers, has five rooms, but only one classroom. But the school is equipped with technology - each student has his or her own laptop - and the students will be prepared for Florida's standardized tests, says Lester.For several years, prinicipal and former teacher Donna King went without a salary as she managed to keep the school open .
