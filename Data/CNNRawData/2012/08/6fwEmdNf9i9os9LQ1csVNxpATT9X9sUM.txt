At the time, the Iranian government said it would make inquiries about Levinson but did not know what happened to him.Later, the FBI said it did not know what group was holding Levinson, what the group's demands might be or even a reason for his capture.Whoever his captors are, they sent a "proof of life" videotape and photographs of Levinson to his family in 2010.In the video, Levinson asked the U.S. government for help: "Please help me get home," said a gaunt-looking Levinson on the tape, citing his 33 years of service in the FBI as a reason for that assistance.Levinson suffers from diabetes and appeared to have lost 50 to 60 pounds since his capture. He turned 64 on March 10. In addition to his wife of 38 years, Levinson has seven children and two grandchildren.Levinson's family aired their angst and anguish in a statement released Tuesday:"Two thousand days since Bob has heard the voices of his children and his wife, and since we have heard his. Two thousand days since he has worn the clothes in his closet -- which we are sure no longer fit him - and 2,000 days since he has slept on his side of the bed."It is time for Bob to be released."
