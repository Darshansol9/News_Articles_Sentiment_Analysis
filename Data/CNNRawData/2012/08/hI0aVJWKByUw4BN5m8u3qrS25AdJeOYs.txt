The other hung from a billboard about a mile from the famed Las Vegas Strip, he said.July jobs report: Hiring picks up, unemployment risesBoth highways are some of the most highly traveled roadways during commuter hours, he said.Elliott called it a "clear case of vandalism" and said the owners of the billboards had not sold the ad space to anyone.Despite the flurry of calls from commuters, Elliott said the signs led to no accidents on the freeways."If there would have been, our involvement would be much deeper," he said.The first calls came in at 6:30 a.m. (9:30 a.m. ET), Elliott said. Lamar Advertising, which owns one of the billboards, removed one of the mannequins a couple of hours later; code enforcement officials from Clark County removed the second one, Elliott said.What would be your reaction if you saw this during your morning commute?
