Jay Patrick Cicinelli, 39, is charged with involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force. They have pleaded not guilty.Tony Bushala, a leading organizer of the Fullerton recall election, said he was seeking accountability for Thomas' death."There was a murder right here at the transportation center of an unarmed homeless man at the hands of our government, our police department, and somebody needs to hold them accountable," Bushala said. "Somebody needs to step up to the plate, and when there's something in the community that's wrong and if you have the money and you have the time, then you need to stop what you're doing and focus on getting your community back on track."Bushala, a property developer in Fullerton, spent more than $200,000 of his own money on the effort to hold the recall election. Bushala is also an activist and blogger.Critics have accused Bushala of trying to install council members who would favor his business interests and development projects, but Bushala denied those accusations and said his efforts were to right a wrong, adding that the police union had too much influence on the city council.On Tuesday, McKinley, one of the three councilmen facing recall, said an "incredible" amount of money was behind the recall campaign.Regarding Thomas' death, McKinley said: "If we would have let our feelings be known that we were appalled by all this -- just like anyone else we were appalled by it -- perhaps it would have quelled it a bit, but I think it would've went forward anyway."The city was expected to spend between $129,000 and $160,000 on the recall election.
