She beat Republican Jesse Kelly, who is hoping to win the seat this time around."The next 72 hours, what we put into it, we'll get out. It's a razor-thin margin," Kelly, a former marine, told supporters at a Republican volunteer phone bank. "You think last time was close, 4,000 votes? They say this one will be in the hundreds. We gotta work the phones."Both campaigns centered around jobs and the economy, with the Republican candidate taking a national approach. Kelly has made defeating President Barack Obama part of his message."He's gonna win this race for us because this nation is tired of his job killing agenda and they [voters] know that I will go to Washington and fight him," he said.Barber, a moderate Democrat, says he supports the president, but he's crafted a local message of helping the middle class in southern Arizona."Middle class Americans feel they're being squeezed by stagnant wages, underemployment and foreclosures," Barber said. "We need to send someone to Congress who is listening to the people and that's what I've been doing."The race has attracted interest and money from outside the district.Super Pacs are at work on both sides, and the Republican National Congressional Committee as well as the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee have ran ads here.Whoever wins the seat Tuesday will hold it for only six months and will start running for re-election almost immediately.That's because come Fall, district lines in the state will move slightly and will become more amenable to Democrats, though still competitive.Winning the special election matters, says Kate Kinski, who teaches government and communications at the University of Arizona."Democrats don't want to lose and Republicans want to ensure that come Fall, and they won't quite have those margins that they have now, that they still have an opportunity to try to win this (new) district," she said.Giffords resigned her seat as she was undergoing rehabilitation after the attack that left left six people dead last year. Her resignation prompted the special election to choose a successor for the remainder of her term in Arizona's 8th District.
