By Michael Martinez and Mariano Castillo, CNN(CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court's decision upholding a piece of Arizona's controversial immigration law portends such a "huge" increase in policing for one department that the chief wondered Tuesday if his agency will be able to handle the workload.At a time when the Tucson Police Department is down 160 officers because of a weakened economy, the agency now must make up to 50,000 additional phone calls a year to federal officials to verify the immigration status of persons whom officers have stopped and have reason to believe are in the country illegally, Police Chief Roberto Villase√±or said Tuesday.Other law agencies in Arizona, however, reported "business as usual" a day after the Supreme Court ruling.
