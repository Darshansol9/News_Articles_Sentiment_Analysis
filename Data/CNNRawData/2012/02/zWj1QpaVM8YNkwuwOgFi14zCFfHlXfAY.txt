"If somebody had a checklist of what a brand should be, Jeremy Lin hits every one."It has been only 10 days since the Harvard graduate was called off the bench, immediately becoming the Knicks' unlikely savior.

"I put one in the window to show people we have them. A short time later, they're gone."President Barack Obama is also apparently "very impressed" with the NBA's new star, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters Wednesday.But some say Lin's appeal and market potential aren't unique.Chinese national Yao Ming, who at 7 feet, 6 inches burst onto the scene during the 2002-03 NBA season, helped his Houston Rockets expand merchandise sales and viewership in Chinese markets over his eight seasons with the team, analysts say.Whether Lin could fill the void left by Yao's retirement is unclear, though some appear cautious."We have to remember, it's only 10 days in," noted Roman Garcia, director of digital strategy at Taylor Strategy, a public relations firm. "We know Lin is really good at pushing the ball down the court but we have yet to see if he's good at pushing a brand, or a community."What's most important, Garcia said, is whether Lin has that potential.
