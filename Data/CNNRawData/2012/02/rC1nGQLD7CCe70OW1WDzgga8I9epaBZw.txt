By Eric Fiegel, CNNWashington (CNN) -- A U.S. Army veteran of both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars is suing the federal government, claiming she and her wife are being denied military benefits that are available to heterosexual married couples.A complaint filed Wednesday in Los Angeles says that the government's definition of marriage is unconstitutional and violates equal protection."We're only asking for the same benefits as other married couples, we simply want the same peace of mind," Tracey Cooper-Harris, the plaintiff, said at a press conference in Washington announcing the lawsuit.
