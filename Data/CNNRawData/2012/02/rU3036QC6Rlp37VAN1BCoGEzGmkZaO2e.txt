Brandon Wilson of the Rio Vista Fire Department. "Initially, she didn't want to go to the hospital."The person that was flying it was very lucky -- very lucky -- to walk away pretty much uninjured."The helicopter, a Robinson R22, went down about eight miles south of the Rio Vista Airport, between San Francisco and Sacramento. It collided with a single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza, which landed near Byron Airport, some 20 miles to the south, said Ian Gregor of the Federal Aviation Administration.Footage of the helicopter showed it resting in a field. KCRA said its severed tail rotor landed about 50 feet away from the fuselage.The plane's pilot was not injured."Absolutely a best-case scenario, very lucky for everybody involved," Wilson said.
