Dohn Community High School, a charter school in Ohio, pays students to attend, CNN affiliate WLWT reported. It helped, at least for the first day: Attendance was at 100%. The money comes from Easter Seals and private donations; seniors get $25 a week and younger kids get $10. Every time students get paid, $5 goes into a savings account they can access when they graduate.
