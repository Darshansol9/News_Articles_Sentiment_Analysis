By David Ariosto, CNN(CNN)-- The Pennsylvania Supreme Court sent a controversial voter ID law back to a lower court on Tuesday to assess the availability of alternative forms of identification and whether the new law disenfranchises voters.The high court said the state's Commonwealth Court has until October 2 to file its response, according to court documents.The lower court, in August, upheld the law requiring that most voters show photo identification before casting ballots."Overall, we are confronted with an ambitious effort on the part of the General Assembly to bring the new identification procedure into effect within a relatively short time frame and an implementation process which has by no means been seamless in light of the serious operational constraints faced by the executive branch," the high court said Tuesday.
