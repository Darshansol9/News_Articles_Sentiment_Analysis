Story highlights Health insurance benefits are not available to undocumented immigrants in deferred statusThe White House says such benefits were never intendedIt leaves those with deferred action with permission to be here, but without all benefitsAs word spread this week that some benefits of the nation's health care law will not extend to the thousands of undocumented immigrants given reprieve from deportation by the Obama administration, advocacy groups were reminded that the youths' status remains much in limbo.The Obama administration earned the praise of immigrant advocacy groups when it decided to grant relief to young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. But a new rule would keep those same immigrants from federal health insurance coverage, putting some in an uncomfortable spot where they have permission to be here, but can't take advantage of all the programs available for others.Some who championed the new immigration policy expressed disappointment at the news, which was more in line with critics of the policy who say that this group should receive no benefits whatsoever because of their legal status.As many as 1.7 million immigrant youths may meet the criteria to be spared from deportation for a renewable two-year period, according to an estimate from the Pew Hispanic Center.JUST WATCHED Undocumented valedictorian stays in U.S. Replay More Videos ...

But, Ranon says, not all jobs provide this benefit.Still, she is supportive of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, as the policy is known. Those who qualify remain in limbo, but they are in a better spot than they were in before, she said."We need to continue putting pressure on the administration and Congress to ensure they don't stay in limbo status," she said.The White House said that DACA is just a stopgap measure for those in the country illegally who were brought as children and pose no danger to national security or the public."It was never intended that those with deferred action under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals process would receive federal financial assistance for health care," Assistant Press Secretary Nick Papas said.Congress still must act to find a permanent solution to the issue of illegal immigration, he said.There will be a cost to excluding deferred status immigrants from health benefits, said Adolph Falcon, senior vice president of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health."The whole purpose was to allow these youths to be a part of American life and convert that promise into economic contributors to society. An important part of that is a healthy workforce," he said.By not providing all resources to help this group get health insurance as youths, it creates unnecessary health risks for their future, he said."It's unfortunate because this is a group that is not expensive to cover at all," he said.
