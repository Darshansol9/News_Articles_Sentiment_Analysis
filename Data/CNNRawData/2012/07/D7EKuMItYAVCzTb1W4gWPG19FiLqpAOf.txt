The reporter's words and narrative moved me and I love that it's an optimistic story about progress. The reporter caught the moment and documented it in a way that would be appreciated by the Sudanese of Khartoum."Vadim Lavrusik:"The narrative is detailed and provides context about some of the broader history for readers.
