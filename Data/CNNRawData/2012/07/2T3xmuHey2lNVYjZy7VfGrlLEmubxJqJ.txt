by Ann Hoevel, CNNA man opened fire in a crowded theater during a midnight showing of the latest Batman movie, killing 12 people and wounding 38. Along with the alleged shooterâ€™s family and the NRA , I expect nerds and other outcasts will get some unwanted attention today.My stomach dropped when I heard news of the mass shooting for the same reasons everyone else's did.But as a nerd and CNN's resident expert on geeky subcultures, I readied myself for pointed questions which I expected to get from outside the geek community: "Why 'Batman'?" "Is the shooter a nerd?" "Why is it always the loner?"
