The Shelbyville, Tennessee, family claimed they feared for their safety after a series of violent episodes from the boy, then 7.An investigation was launched after the child showed up unannounced at Russia's child protection ministry with a letter from his adoptive mother asking Russian authorities to annul the adoption.In the letter, Hansen said the boy was "mentally unstable," and said she had been misled about his mental condition.The World Association for Children and Parents had coordinated the adoption. A lawsuit was filed against Hansen for breach of contract and child support.In May, the association said Artyem is still a U.S. citizen and under Tennessee law Hansen is legally considered to be his mother.According to CNN Nashville affiliate WKRN, Hansen testified Friday in Lewisburg, Tennessee, that the boy wanted to kill her.But Larry Crain, the adoption agency's attorney, said the boy is not violent.
