Similarly, the belief that there is a clear best qualified candidate for every job holds a grain of truth but also leaves room for bucketfuls of hidden biases.I founded the Level Playing Field Institute, which recently studied the impact of hidden bias in tech workplaces, both large companies and start-ups.What was striking was the degree to which engineers and managers in the same companies have day-to-day experiences that dramatically diverge. Even though they’re often are on the same team or in the same department, some feel respected and encouraged, while others feel excluded and ignored.These views aren’t randomly distributed across the group of engineers and managers -- they strongly diverge by race and gender.A particularly striking finding was that while 60% of men in start-ups believe diverse teams are better at innovation and problem-solving, only 41% would be in favor of a companywide hiring practice to increase diversity.Really?If 60% believed, for example, that knowing how to code made for better hires, would only 41% be in favor of hiring people who know how to code?In that same study, women and underrepresented people of color were far more likely to believe in the importance of diverse representation on teams and to support company hiring practices to achieve diversity than their white and male counterparts.Underrepresented people of color were nearly twice as likely as whites to be in favor of a companywide practice to increase diversity (80% compared with 46%). Eighty-two of men in start-ups believed their companies currently spent the “right amount of time” addressing diversity.Until our experiences of our shared workplaces converge, we will continue to confuse “style and fit” with merit.Why does this matter?Because it undermines fundamental fairness and robs individuals, companies and society of the benefit of everyone’s talents.Imagine a company whose innovation was focused on figuring out how to achieve bias-free hiring.Or used to tackle the vexing problems of helping employees balance careers and children, or other life pursuits.As long as we have one and only one model of success -- indeed Mayer spoke of working 20 hours a day at Google and sleeping under her desk -- and one view of what talent looks like (either a graduate or a dropout of a top-tier university), we’ll all lose out.America can’t have a continued high standard of living without finding all available talent, nurturing it and providing opportunities for budding entrepreneurs, investors and employees from every corner.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Freada Kapor Klein.
