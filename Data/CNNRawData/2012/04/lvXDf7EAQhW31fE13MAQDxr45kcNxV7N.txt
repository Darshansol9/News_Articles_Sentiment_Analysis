The following 10 floors are to be reserved for air conditioning, heating, and electrical equipment.Despite years of political infighting and real estate squabbling that delayed its construction, more than half of the building has now been rented, with a tenant list that includes Conde Nast publishing company and a Chinese real estate investment firm called Vantone Holdings.In its shadow, twin reflecting pools are situated in the footprints of where the Twin Towers once stood.The names of the nearly 3,000 people killed in the 2001 attacks, as well as six people who died in the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, are emblazoned across bronze panels ringing the pools.
