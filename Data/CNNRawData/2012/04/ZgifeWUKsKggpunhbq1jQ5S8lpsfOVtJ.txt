Editor’s note: Linda Hallman is executive director and CEO of the American Association of University Women.By Linda Hallman, Special to CNN(CNN) – Today is Equal Pay Day -- the symbolic date marking how long women must work, starting from January 1, 2011, to make what men earned in 2011 alone – although it would be better marked where it should be, December 31.A lot needs to happen to chip away at the extra four months it takes for women’s wages to equal what a man makes in one year, and of course, a change in date assumes a change in data. But the latest numbers show that in 2010, women working full-time in the United States made just 77%, on average, of what men made, a gap of 23% that only widens for women of color.For now, the numbers will keep Equal Pay Day in April and, sadly, not everyone cares.
