Sports Illustrated model Jessica Perez is tired of defending her ethnicity.She is constantly getting question like, “Where are you from really?" and “There’s no way you speak Spanish, right?”No one believes her when she says “Yes, I am Latina,” because of the way she looks. Perez was born in Costa Rica and Spanish is her first language, but she has pale skin, blonde hair and blue eyes -- features people don't typically identify as Latina.Latinas are diverse, she says, and more than what's on TV or in magazines.
