Story highlights Pair lives outside of Washington, where getting around without a car isn't easyColleague submitted airman's name to a military support groupOperation Homefront provides financial help and other assistance for military familiesCouple is expecting, and "they need the vehicle to take care of the baby," group president saysSenior Airman Aaron Becker repairs medical equipment at a clinic for wounded soldiers at Andrews Air Force Base. Co-workers say he is always giving to others, but they also say Becker's a friend in need. A colleague recently submitted his name to a nonprofit military support group to help his family get around.The nomination paid off Monday as Becker and his wife, Mercy, were handed the keys to a late-model SUV, just in time to get ready for their baby, a girl expected in June.The donation comes from the group Operation Homefront, which generates and allocates financial support and other assistance for military families.The couple lives in military housing near the base in the Maryland suburbs outside of Washington, where getting around without a car isn't all that easy."There are things you have to do that aren't on the base," Becker said, "so it's needed. Even getting my wife to her appointments at the hospital and everything else, it's something that, at seven months pregnant, she doesn't really want to walk all the way to the hospital."Operation Homefront President Jim Knotts presents the keys Monday to Aaron and Mercy Becker.Jim Knotts, president of Operation Homefront, said the vehicle came from a government contractor fleet service, which donated it with plenty of mileage remaining to do someone else some good.Becker and his wife rose to the top of the beneficiary list after officials pointed to his efforts maintaining the medical equipment used to treat wounded warriors coming home from battlefields in Afghanistan and Iraq.Knotts said, "In this case, this is a great example of an airman who is just doing a superb job for his country. He and his wife just starting out, they're gonna have their first baby, they don't have a vehicle, they live just off the base, so they need the vehicle to take care of the baby."
