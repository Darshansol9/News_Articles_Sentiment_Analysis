Story highlights Two New Jersey state troopers have been suspended without payAuthorities check allegations that they escorted vehicles that reached triple-digit speedsThe alleged incident occurred on March 30An attorney said the accusations have been exaggeratedTwo New Jersey state troopers have been suspended as authorities investigate allegations they escorted a caravan of high-performance vehicles that reached triple-digit speeds on a state highway, eliciting complaints from other motorists.Nadir Nassry, 47, and Joseph Ventrella, 28, have been suspended without pay, according to a statement earlier this week from state Attorney General Jeffrey S. Chiesa."We will not tolerate any conduct by a member of the State Police that puts the public in jeopardy, as this unauthorized caravan had the potential to do," said Chiesa. "We are thoroughly investigating this incident, and those responsible will face serious discipline."The alleged incident occurred on March 30.No charges have filed, though authorities say they are also investigating a "prior escort."It is not clear if the two incidents are related."I will not tolerate this egregious breach of public safety, and those responsible will be held fully accountable," said New Jersey State Police Superintendent Col. Joseph R. Fuentes.An attorney for Ventrella could not be immediately reached for comment.Charles J. Sciarra, Nassry's attorney, said the accusations have been exaggerated, while headlines in local media, such as the New Jersey Star Ledger's reference to "Death Race 2012," have unfairly targeted his client."The headlines scream 'Death Race 2012' when in fact these charitable organizations routinely ask and receive escorts from the State Police to and from the various charitable functions they attend with their exotic vehicles," said Sciarra. "With this particular escort, the allegations of recklessness and speeds in the triple digits will not bear out."He added, "This practice has been in effect for years."
