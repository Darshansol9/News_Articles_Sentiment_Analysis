That's an increase of 22% since 2008, when there were 19.5 million Latinos in America who met the country's voting requirements.While both Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama have aggressively courted Latino voters, the turnout rate for the group in 2008 - 50% -- was lower than that of black voters (65%) and white voters (66%).And the decrease in voter registration between the 2008 election and the 2010 for Latinos was sharp - 600,000 fewer Latinos registered to vote in the midterm elections than they did for the presidential contest two years earlier.Read More
