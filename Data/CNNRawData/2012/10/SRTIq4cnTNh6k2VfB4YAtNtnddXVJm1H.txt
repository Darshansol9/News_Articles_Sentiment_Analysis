I'm happy."He said he made sure he had informed and gained the support of his family, friends, ex-boyfriends, teammates, manager and promoter before coming out."I have always been and always will be a proud gay man," he said in a public announcement on October 3, according to Time.comPublic reaction -- including from fellow Puerto Rican boxing champion Miguel Cotto -- has been positive and encouraging, he said.Cotto told him, "It's OK, Orlando. I support you. It's good. It's your decision, and I respect your decision," Cruz said.He said he's also received support and guidance from high-profile gay rights activist Pedro Julio Serrano and singer Ricky Martin."Wow. Ricky Martin," Cruz said with a smile. "Two days ago he called and texted me, 'Relax, Orlando. I support you.
