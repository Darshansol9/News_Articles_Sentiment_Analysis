"If he continues to hit these markers, then if his daughter wants a dog two or three years down the line ... I'm saying that we should be open to that possibility."Under the terms of his conviction, Vick had been barred from owning an animal.The NFL suspended Vick in August 2007 after he pleaded guilty to a federal charge of paying for a dogfighting operation in Virginia. He returned to the NFL in 2009.
