The railroad industry is offering veterans jobs because its business is growing and new jobs will soon open up as more people start to retire, he added.The railroad association is working with the Department of Veteran Affairs to make sure that 500 railroad companies -- including freight, inter-city passenger and commuter railroads -- are committed to offering military servicemen and women jobs."The railway industry clearly recognizes that hiring veterans is good for their companies, bottom line, and we are appreciative of their efforts to serve veterans as well as they have served the country," said Brad Cooper, executive director of Joining Forces, a White House initiative to provide opportunities and support to service members and their families.Some 1,600 companies have hired more than 90,000 veterans and military spouses in the past year. These same companies have committed to hiring 170,000 in the coming years. The rail industry initiative was launched last year by first lady Michelle Obama and Jill Biden, wife of Vice President Joe Biden.Last month, LaHood and Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki announced a new portal on the VA website that will help veterans find jobs in the transportation industry."We are proud to offer our heroes transitioning from military service the opportunity for another career in service to our country," Hamberger said. It's a "great mesh of their characteristics and leadership learned in the armed forces. It's a win-win."Currently, more 15,000 veterans work for the Department of Transportation, including 3,000 with disabilities.
