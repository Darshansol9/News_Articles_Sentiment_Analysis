Story highlights An 81 year-old Rhode Island resident comes forward as the winner of the Powerball lottery"I'm very happy and I'm very proud," said Louise WhiteIt was the third largest prize in the game's historyLouise White, an 81 year-old Rhode Island resident, came forward Tuesday as the winner of a $336.4 million Powerball lottery, the third largest prize in the game's history."I'm very happy and I'm very proud," she said. "We are truly blessed. Thank you."White bought the winning ticket last month in Newport, Rhode Island, after a family member had a craving for rainbow sherbet and brought her to a store where she purchased the ticket."We're very excited to be a part of this little bit of history; the winner is a lovely woman and valued customer," said store employee Suzi Robinson. "We are very happy for her."After realizing she had won, White tucked the winning ticket into her Bible and went to sleep holding the Bible, bringing it with her to breakfast the next day until she could eventually store it in a safe deposit box.White then sought legal counsel and established a trust for the funds, according to her attorney, Gregory Fater.It's called the Rainbow Sherbert Trust, named for the snack that prompted her visit to the store, even though the correct spelling is sherbet.Fater described White as "extremely grounded," and approached her newfound wealth with "extreme poise and level headedness."White elected to take the cash option and will receive a lump sum payment of $210 million, the highest cash option payout ever for Powerball, according to lottery officials.The state of Rhode Island will collect $14.7 million, while the federal government also tallies up to $52.5 million in revenue.
