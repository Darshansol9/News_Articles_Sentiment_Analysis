"For decades, Sue has been a critical part of New York's longest tenured anchor team in the city and has more than earned her iconic status."The announcement of her departure spawned a "Save Sue Simmons" Facebook page, and prompted other social media postings about her past exploits.Her anchoring is punctuated by what some called a quintessential New York attitude, and her often sassy comments, smirks and grins go against what might be considered typical news anchor decor.Jack Cafferty, a CNN commentator who co-anchored with Simmons for 13 of the 32 years she has worked for WNBC, called her a "breath of fresh air in the otherwise stuffy, pretentious world of journalism."Mark Harris, a columnist for Entertainment Weekly, tweeted: "Fellow New Yorkers, I hope you all get that this is wrong, stupid and evil,"Her newscast was ranked No. 1 in the fiercely competitive New York local news market this year among advertisers' favorite demographic, ages 25 to 54.Simmons did not immediately return calls seeking comment.The contract of her co-anchor, Chuck Scarborough, 68, has been renewed for another three years.Simmons' role had been diminished in recent years, anchoring only the station's 11 p.m. newscast. The show dropped her from the 6 p.m. slot last year after she returned from back surgery.She will remain on the air until her contract expires, the station said.
