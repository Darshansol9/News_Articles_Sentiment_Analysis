The flames picked up significantly the next day, fanned by strong winds and high temperatures.Dry conditions have exacerbated the fire danger throughout the region, but one-quarter inch to three-quarters of an inch of rain fell on the first late Monday, with more rain falling on the southern end of the wildfire, authorities said.On Friday, Gov. Rick Snyder banned outdoor burning in 49 counties in northern Michigan in hopes of preventing wildfires.
