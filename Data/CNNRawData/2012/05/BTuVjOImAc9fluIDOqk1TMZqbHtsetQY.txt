His FBI-issued service revolver is also missing, Eimiller said.Investigators and volunteers working for local police, as well as about 50 FBI agents, had searched the rugged Verdugo Mountains after bloodhounds tracked his scent in the area, according to authorities.Authorities have since scaled back, but have not ended, the mountain search, Eimiller said."We're not ruling out that he may have gone in a different direction," she said.Ivens is white, 6-feet-tall and weighs approximately 160 pounds. He wears prescription glasses, police said, and is described as having brown hair with a receding hair line and brown eyes.FBI agent Steven Gomez told CNN affiliate KCAL that he could not expand on Ivens' duties beyond that he handled "national security-type" work."That's all I can really say about his casework."
