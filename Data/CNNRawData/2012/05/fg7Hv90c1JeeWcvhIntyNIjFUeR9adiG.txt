by AJ WillinghamWake up! Life is happening here. Right now.Sometimes we forget that, and if wisdom truly is wasted on the young, the worst time to impart wisdom is to a bunch of exhausted twenty-somethings in rickety folding chairs trying not to scratch where that rented gown is making them itch.Whether or not you've walked across that stage, commencement speeches are best enjoyed like fine wine: thoughtfully, and with a little age. Here are some of our favorite graduation quotes to inspire your day:“Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition… Stay hungry. Stay foolish.” – Steve Jobs, Stanford University, 2005
