Comedian and "Daily Show" correspondent Aasif Mandvi recently told CNN's Suzanne Malveaux that casting in some Hollywood movies, like "The Hunger Games," and "The Dictator," which stars English actor Sacha Baron Cohen as a North African dictator, illustrate an "attitude that white is the normal and everything else is not."Mandvi said that when films like "The Hunger Games" take a role written as ethnic and cast it with a white actor, they fail to accurately reflect the diversity of modern life."Fifty years ago you could almost excuse it, but today you do have a much more multi-ethnic society," Mandvi said.
