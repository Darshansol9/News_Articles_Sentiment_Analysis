"We are truly devastated by her disappearance. It's totally out of character for us not to have heard from her, and we fear foul play."Holding a stuffed bunny named BB, his daughter's favorite plush toy and "guardian angel," John Graham pleaded last weekend for someone to come forward with information on his daughter, who he said loved helping people."Last spring break, instead of hanging around on the beach, she spent a week in Tuscaloosa rebuilding houses," her father said.The Northern Virginia native is 5 feet 11 inches tall with a slender build and has light brown hair, blue eyes and freckles. She was last seen September 13 wearing a black crop top, according to a UVA news releaseWhere was she before her disappearance?On the evening of September 12, she was seen at a party before friends saw her at an apartment complex a couple of blocks away from the party. That was shortly before midnight, according to a timeline compiled by CNN affiliate WVIRAbout 12:45 a.m. on September 13, a surveillance camera caught her outside of a pub, about three-quarters of a mile from the apartment complex. A doorman turned her away at the pub, Longo said Sunday.Ten minutes later, she is seen running past a gas station -- no one appears to be pursuing her -- and witnesses say they saw her five minutes later roughly four blocks from the gas station, WVIR reported. She was at a restaurant in an area known as Downtown Mall, witnesses said.JUST WATCHED 'Person of interest' in Hannah Graham case Replay More Videos ...

She and a man were seen having drinks at a bar between 1:30 and 2 a.m., WVIR reports.Police believe she may have been under the influence of alcohol, Longo said, and may have been vulnerable or unable to defend herself.What are police doing to find her?"I believe Jesse Matthew was the last person she was seen with before she vanished off the face of the Earth," the police chief said Sunday. "We want to talk to him."Anyone who saw Matthew's burnt-orange 1998 Chrysler coupe that night should call the police tip line at 434-295-3851, Longo said.Police had previously said they were looking for a man who did not fit Matthew's description, but rather was a black male in his 20s or 30s with a shaved head and goatee. Matthew has dreadlocks."I hope and pray that we might have an opportunity to talk to Jesse Matthew again because I think he can help up find Hannah Graham," the police chief said.In addition to Monday's search warrant, authorities previously searched Matthew's apartment and car but have declined to say what -- if anything -- was found.They have interviewed at least 50 people and received more than 100 tips in the case. Last weekend, more than 1,200 volunteers and Virginia Department of Emergency Management officials spent the weekend searching for clues that would lead them to Graham, CNN affiliate WTVR reportedAs time passes, the search area grows, investigators say.Authorities are offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to Graham's safe return.What we don't knowWhere is Matthew?Matthew willingly went to a police station last weekend, along with several family members, walking through the front door and asking for a lawyer, the police chief said. There was no warrant for his arrest at that time.Matthew and the lawyer spoke and then left, Longo said, giving detectives no clearer picture of what may have happened the day Graham disappeared.Police executed a new search warrant at his home Monday, and Matthew's landlord told WVIR that police took two items.She also told WVIR that she hadn't seen Matthew since Thursday, and two of his roommates had moved out.The University of Virginia Medical Center confirmed to WVIR that Matthew has worked there since August 12.Matthew is known to have contacts in Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington, according to police.Are there links to other cases?The short answer is no. However, the Route 29 corridor where Graham disappeared has a peculiar history.According to WTVR, Graham is the fourth woman to disappear from the area since 2009. Morgan Harrington of Charlottesville, Alexis Murphy of Lovingston and Samantha Clarke of Orange also went missing there.All the women were between 17 and 20 years old, WVIR reported.In July, Randy Taylor, 43, was sentenced to two life terms for Murphy's 2013 abduction and murder, although her body was never found, WVIR reported.Clarke's mother is still looking for answers more than four years after her 19-year-old's disappearance.Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student, went missing after attending a Metallica concert in Charlottesville in October 2009. Her remains were found on a farm months later.Police have yet to track down her killer, and her family has long said they suspect there could be other victims. The T-shirt Harrington was wearing when she disappeared was found near where Graham disappeared."Certainly the question has arisen. It's certainly a legitimate question," Longo told reporters this month.Harrington's mother told WTVR that Route 29 has an "infamous reputation.""I don't know. Either there is a commonality or a crime spree," she told WTVR. "We have long passed a critical mass that needs looking at. If you look at the map of missing and abducted along Route 29 -- it's not a normal pattern."
