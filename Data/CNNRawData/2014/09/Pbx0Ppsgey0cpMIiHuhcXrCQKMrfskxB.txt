Story highlights Minnesota trades star Kevin Love to the Cleveland CavaliersHe'll team up LeBron James, who recently rejoined the CavsTimberwolves get the Cavs' last two No. 1 draft picksLove is all LeBron needs.Or so the Cleveland Cavaliers hope.The NBA doormat-turned-upstart squad from northeastern Ohio officially got its second big jolt of excitement this offseason on Saturday, with the announcement that Kevin Love is coming its way in a trade."Welcome to the Land @kevinlove!" James tweeted.Love, who averaged 26.1 points and 12.5 assists a game with the Minnesota Timberwolves, joins LeBron James in ClevelandIt was James' return to the Cavaliers -- the club he famously made "The Decision" to leave four years ago for the Miami Heat -- that was the NBA's biggest move, by far, since the San Antonio Spurs beat the Heat for the championship.Unlike what he'd done after joining Miami, the four-time league Most Valuable Player didn't promise he'd bring any titles to Cleveland. Part of that may have to do with the fact he didn't have the same supporting cast as he had in Miami, where he suited up with Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh.But the arrival of Love -- one of the top scorers and rebounders in the NBA -- could change the expectations.The two newcomers join a squad that for the past few years has been led by point guard Kyrie Irving. Other holdovers include Dion Waiters and Anderson Varejao. Still, it's not like Cleveland last few season have been successful: There's a reason they had the No. 1 overall draft pick -- which typically goes to one of the NBA's worst team -- three of the last four years.Cleveland didn't get Love, a forward, for free. They gave up two potentially big stars, and their last two No. 1 picks, in Andrew Wiggins and Anthony Bennett, to the Timberwolves.The Cavaliers surrendered their first-round pick in the 2015 NBA Draft to Philadelphia.The 76ers got guard Alexey Shved and forward Luc Richard Mbah a Moute from Minnesota and traded veteran forward Thaddeus Young to the Timberwolves as part of the three-team swap.
