"We continue to be optimistic that Hannah will soon be returned safely to us."The police chief said he has not given up hope Graham will be found. "I will always be hopeful until we find Hannah," he said.Graham's parents haven't given up hope either, he said. "They are hurt. They are concerned. They are frustrated," he said. "But not for one second have I discerned that they have ever lost hope they will find their daughter."
