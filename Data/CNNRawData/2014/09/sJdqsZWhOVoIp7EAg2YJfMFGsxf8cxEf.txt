MUST WATCH Official: Two firefighters released 01:35Firefighter Simon Alex Quinn, also injured in the Ice Bucket Challenge, was released from the hospital Tuesday, according to Coker.During the ALS stunt, Grider and Quinn were inside a bucket on a ladder above the students. When they finished dumping water, the students left and the firefighters began moving the ladder, authorities told CNN. The bucket came close to power lines and shocked the men, officials said.Two firefighters who were on the ground -- Capt. Steve Marrs, 37, and Alex Johnson, 28 -- were shocked when they tried to lower the bucket and an electric current traveled down the extended ladder, Campbellsville Police Chief Tim Hazlette said at the time.Marrs and Johnson were taken to the hospital and later released, he said.An investigation is ongoing. Hazlette told CNN in August that the ladder did not actually touch the power lines.The power company told investigators that if one gets within a distance of three to four feet from a power line, the energy that surrounds the voltage wire can arc and electrocute other objects, Hazlette told CNN. That's what authorities believe happened in this case.
