When the officer got out of his car to question him, the man ran, and the officer gave chase.Then the man spun around with a handgun and "fired shots at the officer," the statement read. One struck the officer in the left arm.The officer shot back, police said, but there was no indication that he hit the suspect, who ducked into a wooded area, eluding the officer.Police from neighboring areas joined Ferguson police to search for the suspect for more than an hour but could not find him. He is still at large.In the aftermath of the shooting, county police officials gave differing accounts of what led up to it, saying at one point that it involved two suspects who spontaneously ran from the officer's squad car.Belmar told reporters the officer was very close to two suspects when one turned on him with a gun. He said the officer blocked the gun with his arm and then was shot.Police later said the account of two suspects was incorrect.The officer was wearing a body camera, according to the Saint Louis County sheriff's office, but it was "not activated," officials said.The wounded officer was able to speak and told colleagues about the incident, police said.Separate shootingIn a separate incident hours later, gunmen fired at a car driven by an off-duty St. Louis city police officer on an interstate highway. The officer was in his private vehicle and was not wearing a uniform shirt at the time.The gunmen passed the officer on the left and shot his vehicle multiple times with handguns, police said in a statement.The gunfire did not appear to hit the officer, who suffered minor scratches from breaking glass."It is unclear at this time if the officer was targeted or if this was a random act of violence," county police said in a statement.The officer did not return fire.Heated Ferguson responsesSome people were quick to connect the officer's shooting with the tensions that have beset Ferguson since Brown was killed August 9.Photos: The funeral of Michael Brown Photos: The funeral of Michael Brown Michael Brown's casket arrives at St. Peter's Cemetery on Monday, August 25, 2014 for his funeral.

A scuffle ensued, and arrests were made.Wading into the crowd, Jackson apologized for his department's actions after the shooting, but pledged not to resign. "I'm sorry, and I said that from my heart," he said. "I had to get that off my chest. It's been sitting there for two months.""If you are not resigning tonight, go home," one man said on a bullhorn.Brown's shooting stirred complaints of widespread racial profiling in Ferguson, which Jackson rejected Thursday."It's never been the intention of the Ferguson Police Department -- or any police department that I know -- to intentionally target individuals because of race," said the chief. "If there is that happening, it's a crime and it needs to be addressed."
