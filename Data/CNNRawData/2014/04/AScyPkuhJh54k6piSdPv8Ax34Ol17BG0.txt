Story highlights "Ridiculous" last-minute shot lifts Kentucky over WisconsinConnecticut tops favorite Florida for trip to title gameA record crowd of 79,444 attends Saturday night's gameSo it comes down to Kentucky and Connecticut.With just seconds left on the clock, Kentucky freshman Aaron Harrison sank a "ridiculous" three-pointer to give the Wildcats a 74-73 win over Wisconsin in the Final Four of the NCAA men's basketball tournament Saturday night. Kentucky will face Connecticut in Monday's title game, after the Huskies came back to oust top-seeded Florida 63-53 earlier Saturday.Neither team was expected to make it this far. Kentucky was a No. 8 seed in its region, while Connecticut was No. 7.Kentucky coach John Calipari said Wisconsin could have easily come out on top before the late toss by Harrison, who has hit two other key long baskets in the tournament."They did everything they were supposed to do to win the game, and then we made a ridiculous shot," he said at a postgame press conference. "We hung on and so did Wisconsin. It was a heck of a game."JUST WATCHED John Calipari: A Fresh(man) perspective Replay More Videos ...

"When we're down ... they grow hair on their necks," he said. Kentucky will feature the first all-freshman starting lineup in the national championship game since the 1992 Michigan team nicknamed "The Fab Five."After Harrison's three-pointer, Wisconsin's Traevon Jackson got off one last shot as time expired -- but it missed the goal."I felt pretty good that he got to that spot where he's hit shots before," Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan said. "It just didn't go."Attendance was a record 79,444 Saturday night at the Final Four at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, where the championship game will also be played.
