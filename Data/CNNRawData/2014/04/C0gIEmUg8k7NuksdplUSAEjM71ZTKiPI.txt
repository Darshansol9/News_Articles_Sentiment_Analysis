Very tough call to handle, please give benefit of doubt."The city of Denver auditor's office this year began studying police response times, which have grown longer in recent years, the Denver Post reported. The report is expected in June, and police have cited fewer officers and limited budgets for hiring more officers since 2008 as causes for longer response times, the newspaper reported.Lance Kirk, brother of Richard Kirk, told KWGN that he was stunned to hear of the incident."I know that wasn't Richard -- let's just say that," Lance Kirk told the news outlet. "I hope there are some answers that come out about this."My heart goes out to those three boys and Kris' family -- mom, dad, sister and brothers," Lance Kirk added, referring to his sister-in-law.
