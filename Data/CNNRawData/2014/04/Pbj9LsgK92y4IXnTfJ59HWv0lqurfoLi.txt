The bus veered into the median and ran through a cable barrier before crashing into a Chevy Tahoe and tractor-trailer in the westbound lanes."This tragedy was the result of blunt-force impact to the front tire that weakened its internal structure and caused the tire's failure. There was no evidence of any pre-existing condition to the tire," Col. Tracy Trott of the Tennessee Highway Patrol said.He added that there is no evidence any of the drivers in the crash were impaired or distracted. There was also nothing to indicate the bus wasn't well-maintained, he said.The bus, which was owned by Front Street Baptist Church in Statesville, North Carolina, was carrying 18 passengers, five of whom were ejected and killed. Another died inside the bus, while one of the three occupants of the Tahoe died, as did the tractor-trailer's driver.JUST WATCHED Tennessee bus crash leaves 8 dead Replay More Videos ...
