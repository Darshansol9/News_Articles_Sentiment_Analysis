I think the end result is right where it needs to be," said council chairwoman Mary Mulvenna.As of now, NCAA rules say athletes may be provided three meals a day or a food stipend. The new rule would apply to scholarship and nonscholarship athletes.Other proposals from the council included reducing the penalty for first time offenders of a positive test for street drugs like marijuana during championships and requiring football players to take at least three-hour breaks between practices during preseason.The drugs penalty will be suspension for half a season instead of a full season, the NCAA said. If approved the measures would take effect August 1.
