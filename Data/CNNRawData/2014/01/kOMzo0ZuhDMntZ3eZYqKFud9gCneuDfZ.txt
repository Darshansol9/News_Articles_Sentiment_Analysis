Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency because of the storm.State offices were closed in 38 parishes, according to the governor's office.

Anything I can do or should I just bust it out with a hammer?"Although the winter storm warning had been lifted for the Houston area Friday afternoon, forecasters warned that bridges, overpasses and other wet spots could freeze again after dark on Friday.'Stay off the roads'Icy conditions remained sketchy."We still have ice on the roads and overpasses. A lot of roadways are closed, and nearly all of our interstates have ramp closures or lane closures because of the overpasses," said Michael Walter, a spokesman for Houston's emergency management agency, said."If you don't need to be on the roads, stay off them," he added.Icy conditions also caused delays at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport, he said. About 100 flights have been delayed.High winds associated with the storm also forced the U.S. Coast Guard to suspend shipping through the Houston Ship Channel. While the channel remained closed Friday morning, the Coast Guard hoped to have it reopened by afternoon, Lt.

Close enough."In Austin, Texas, schools were closed amid icy conditions that caused more than 200 wrecks, CNN affiliate KVUE reportedIndiana pileupWinter weather caused more serious problems on Thursday in Indiana, where three people died in a 46-vehicle accident in whiteout conditions on Interstate 94, state police Sgt. Ann Wojas said Friday. Twenty-two people were injured, two critically.The accident -- which was said to have involved 20 trucks and 26 private vehicles -- stretched for more than a mile, according to Lt. Jerry Williams, district commander for the Indiana State Police.A fire official who responded to the crash told reporters "we're lucky there wasn't 210 people dead and three injured."It took firefighters hours to rescue all of the victims, including two who were airlifted to nearby hospitals in critical condition.Wojas identified the dead as Marilyn Wolma, 65 and her husband, Thomas Wolma, 67, both of Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Gerry Dalrymple, 65, of Chicago.The interstate's eastbound lanes remained closed early Friday, the Indiana Department of Transportation said.Officials hoped to reopen the lanes Friday morning, but it will take much longer to fully understand what happened and why, Wojas said."This investigation will take several weeks, if not months, to complete," she said.Officials have removed the last vehicle involved in the wreck, CNN affiliate WLS reported.Propane shortagesAlso, propane shortages across the country are causing prices to spike, pinching consumers looking to keep ahead of bitter cold winter weather in many places."We have double blankets on the beds, the couch, the kids' beds. I don't know what else to do," said Sandy DeHorn, who said prices for propane rose from $2.69 to $5 in one day."How can that happen?" she said.Alabama's governor declared a state of emergency related to propane sales, activating the state's price-gouging law.The law doesn't set a specific limit for prices but says anything more than 25 percent above the average price over the last month represents illegal "unconscionable pricing."More than 12 million U.S. households use propane to keep warm, according to an industry trade group. Supplies are short because of increased demand due to the cold weather and increased usage by corn farmers last fall, who used extra propane to dry a bumper crop of corn.
