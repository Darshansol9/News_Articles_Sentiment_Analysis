There will be no funeral procession at the family's request."We want to honor him in a way family and friends will remember and look at him as a hero," Ebmeyer said. "He should be looked at as going above and beyond, even putting his life in danger... This is what firefighters do."Tyler, an East Rochester resident, was staying at the home of relatives in Penfield on January 19 when he noticed a fire in the single-wide trailer, officials said.As firefighters and sheriff's deputies responded to a 4:45 a.m. emergency call, Tyler was able to wake six other people in the small trailer, including two more children, ages 4 and 6, the fire officials said.Then Tyler went back into the blaze to help his grandfather, who was disabled and would have been unable to get out of the home on his own. "By that time, the fire had traveled to the back of the trailer," Ebmeyer said at the time. "Unfortunately, they both succumbed to heat and smoke."The pair were found together on a bed in the back room. It appeared that the boy was trying to lift his grandfather from the bed when he was overcome by the smoke and fire, fire officials said.The funeral Mass will take place at 10 a.m. Wednesday at St. John of Rochester Catholic Church in Fairport.
