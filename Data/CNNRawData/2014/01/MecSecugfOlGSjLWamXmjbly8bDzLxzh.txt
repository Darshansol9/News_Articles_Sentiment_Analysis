A second body was found Friday in the remains of a three-story Minneapolis apartment building where an explosion and fire happened Wednesday, the Minneapolis Fire Department said.The explosion, which happened on the morning of New Year's Day at 516 Cedar Ave. S., injured at least 14 other people, officials have said. Many of of the injuries suffered were burns or came from falls or jumps from windows, said Robert Ball, a spokesman for Hennepin County Emergency Medical Services.The fire's cause still is under investigation. The fire department said a gas leak could be a potential cause, but it could be weeks before a determination is made.Firefighters found the first body Wednesday while they were removing debris. The explosion was reported about 8:15 a.m., and the building was soon engulfed in flames, officials said.
