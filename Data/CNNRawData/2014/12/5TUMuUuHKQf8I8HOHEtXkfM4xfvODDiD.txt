Story highlights Attorney general says he will not try to force reporter to reveal sourceThe issue had been at the center of a long legal battleAttorney General Eric Holder has decided not to seek to compel New York Times reporter James Risen to reveal a confidential source, according to a law enforcement official familiar with Holder's decision.The Justice Department has been engaged in a long legal battle with Risen over his source for a story regarding a U.S. effort aimed at disrupting Iran's nuclear program.Holder has told Justice Department prosecutors they can still subpoena Risen, but will not push him to reveal information about the identity of his source. Instead, he would be asked to confirm he had an agreement with the source and that he did write a book about the matter.The Risen matter is part of an ongoing trial of former CIA official Jeffrey Sterling, who is accused of leaking classified information. The judge overseeing the case had set a deadline of Tuesday for the Justice Department to decide what to do regarding the Risen matter.Risen, via Twitter, said his lawyer has not heard from the government and that he will not respond until that happens."This issue is hardly resolved," New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet said. "One of the country's best investigative reporters could still be put in the position of having to testify about a source."
