Story highlights Official: "It appears to be a case of too much salt and too little wall"No one is hurtSometimes the headlines write themselves.An overburdened wall at a salt warehouse in Chicago collapses spilling a mountain of white crystals on cars parked at the neighboring Acura dealership.The building is a Morton's Salt facility. Their iconic motto? "When it rains, it pours.""It appears to be a case of too much salt and too little wall," fire department spokesman Larry Langford told CNN affiliate WBBM.Thankfully, the tons of salt didn't hurt anyone but according to CNN's affiliate, WLS-TV, nearly a dozen cars were damaged.The station talked with Michael Cristofano, one of the unlucky owners.Cristofano dropped his car off for an oil change and is now thanking his lucky stars it wasn't worse."I first found it surprising and laughable. Then you start to think what could have happened. Someone could have been in the car," he told WLS-TV.City officials say Morton's is working with them to make sure the structure won't sustain any further damage.Meanwhile next door, the car salesmen are digging cars out instead of moving them off the lot."Usually it's a busy time for us," Noble Jones the general manager of McGrath Acura told WLS-TV. "We're worried more about selling cars, not saving cars. But it seems right now we have to dig some cars out from the salt."
