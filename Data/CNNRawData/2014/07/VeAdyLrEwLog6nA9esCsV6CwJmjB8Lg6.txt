Andrew Tahmooressi's next day in court is August 4.Tahmooressi has maintained that he took a wrong turn on the California side of the border into Tijuana.

Tahmooressi told CNN that's "a lie.""That's not true at all. They never told me anything of that sort," he said in jailhouse interview on Sunday.Tahmooressi said the Spanish translator provided to him at the border added to the confusion in communication."After I had got off the phone with 911 and I felt like there was no one there to help me, I even told them, I said, 'You can take my guns, take my truck and take all my possessions, just let me go back to America.' And they shook their head no in frustration."Asked by CNN if he believes he should receive punishment for his mistake, Tahmooressi said no."I feel like the punishment was never necessary from the beginning. But once the (Mexican) military people got involved, they were like, 'Look what we found, we found these guns, good for us. Let's get this guy incriminated.' There was some good people at the border who were going to do the right thing, and that's how it should have been from the start."Following Wednesday's hearing, Jill Tahmooressi meet with her son for 20 minutes. They both remain hopeful."He is strong, he is confident and he is very privileged to have Mr. Benitez defend his innocence," she said.
