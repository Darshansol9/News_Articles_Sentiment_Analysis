Technology has.So, Burton also plans to use part of the donations to spread digital offerings to mobile phones and video game consoles.Inspired by 'Roots'Burton said he realized the power of TV as a medium for educating and informing viewers when he played Kunta Kinte on the "Roots" miniseries, based on Alex Haley's novel about slavery.The story captured the nation as millions tuned in to watch the miniseries that during the late 1970s gave dignity to the experience of African-Americans.Decades later, after reading a book on an iPad for the first time, he saw the potential to create an interactive reading experience. Burton acquired the rights to the "Reading Rainbow" brand and created his company, RRKidz.He envisioned an app that could interact with the audience in ways the show never could.He launched it in 2012, and in its first 18 months, users read 10 million books, making it the No. 1 free educational app in the iTunes store for two years."I wanted to put in the hands of kids a library of books and videos, like the TV show did, all in the service of inspiring a love of literature and exploring the world -- connecting the real world to the literature that kids are reading," said Burton, who received the Impact Award for his efforts to instill "a lifelong love of reading in children" during Children's Book Week.Burton has said that he would like underserved children to have access to more diverse books. He believes that they should be able to see themselves in characters that appear in literature they read.Dire needReading Rainbow expands into a growing literary desert among youths in the United States. In the last 30 years, children and adolescents say they have spent markedly less of their recreational time with books, according to research by advocacy group Common Sense Media.On his TV show, Burton became a trusted friend to children, parents and educators, recommending a variety of books and taking viewers on book-related field trips. He invited kids to recommend books in a segment, using the famous line, "but you don't have to take my word for it."It was his cue to children to pick up a book themselves. Burton hopes more of them who should read more often will be able to soon.
