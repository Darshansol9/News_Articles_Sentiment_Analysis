The office also tweeted that there was some flooding just south of downtown.The storm's strongest sustained winds were 100 mph.North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory told residents and tourists to stay inside while it was dark outside. He said the potential track for the storm would move it closer to land."We did not expect this western movement," he told reporters Thursday night.

The bad news: the storm was now stronger.CNN correspondents at Wrightsville Beach near Wilmington and Atlantic Beach said most people in those two tourist destinations were heeding authorities' calls to stay out of the surf.JUST WATCHED Which areas will Hurricane Arthur impact?

"The guests are hanging tight. They seem to be having a good time. They're ready to wait it out."At the Frying Pan Tower, 34 miles offshore from Wilmington, Richard Neal said the winds had shaken the old Coast Guard light station enough to cause some apprehension.Neal has turned the tower into an "adventure bed and breakfast."But after 99 mph winds and 35-foot waves, he said, "We were not expecting it to be this much of an adventure."Neal said there were no guests there and he and his children were sitting around playing cards as the eye passed through.He warned people on land to evacuate."These are very large waves and the swells are enormous," he said.Arthur is expected to bring storm surges of up to 7 feet, as well as large, damaging waves, high winds and dangerous rip currents that authorities warned could sweep even the strongest swimmers out to sea.Hurricane warnings were up for most of the state's coastline. Parts of Massachusetts, South Carolina and Virginia were under tropical storm warnings. The National Hurricane Center said the storm was moving to the north-northeast.A tornado watch was in effect for 10 counties of North Carolina.McCrory declared a state of emergency for 23 eastern counties.

To avoid tragedy, they should stay on land.The storm is expected to spawn deadly rip currents: rapid flows of water from the shore back out to the ocean that can pull people to sea and exhaust even the strongest swimmers.Tropical cyclones killed six people in 2009, the National Weather Service said. All drowned in large waves or rip currents.Despite the warnings, a handful of families frolicked in the surf Thursday in Atlantic Beach, North Carolina.Among them was Derek Cornwall's family, who arrived for vacation in the resort town late Wednesday."We were banking on a couple of hours today before the storm moves in," he said.His daughter, Hannah, was taking full advantage, playing in the waves despite being "a little nervous" about the storm."But I'm actually kind of excited because I've never been in a severe storm," she said. "It's kind of on my bucket list."Robin Banning, her children and a friend planned to ride out the storm at a Walmart parking lot in Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina. They had relocated there from an RV campsite closer to where the storm is expected to hit, but didn't want to go home to Virginia."I lived through Bertha," she said, referring to the 2008 hurricane that killed three people. "This is good. It's just rain."Keeping the Boston Pops dryDespite the risks farther south, the storm shouldn't force a total washout of East Coast Independence Day celebrations.With rain forecast for parts of New England on Friday, the annual Fourth of July Boston Pops concert was moved to Thursday.If it rains then, the fireworks part of the show can start, but the concert may have to go, event organizer Rich MacDonald told CNN affiliate WCVB . "It affects the instruments, and these instruments are valuable and old."In the nation's capital, the weather looks cheerier for the holiday.The slight chance of rain during the day Friday will vanish by night, leaving clear skies for the rockets' red glare of fireworks over the National Mall.However, Thursday's rehearsal was closed to the public because of storms.
