Some letters did not contain any powder.The language used in the letters as well as the method for sending them indicate that Truong was responsible, authorities said.The Justice Department said the letters were sent to government offices, aerospace companies, schools, day care facilities, and hotels in the vicinity of this year's Super Bowl.Separately, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN the letters were also addressed to Obama and members of Congress.
