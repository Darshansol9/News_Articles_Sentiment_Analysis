After he was released in May in exchange for five senior Taliban members held by the U.S. military, Bergdahl has undergone counseling and been given medical care at a hospital in San Antonio.On Monday, he began his job with a unit responsible for homeland defense, civil support operations and security cooperation programs involving countries such as Canada, Mexico and the Bahamas.

Colonel Alayne Conway said last week.
