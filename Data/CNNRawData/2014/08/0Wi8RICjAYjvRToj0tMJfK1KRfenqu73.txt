It was not immediately clear how long they had been there.The remains were reported Friday on the banks of the Mattole River, according to a statement from the Sheriff's Office, and were identified through dental records.Miller was featured in Episode 1 of "The Hunt." Authorities had been looking for him since May 2013.On May 7, 2013, a 911 dispatcher got a call from the Miller residence. The sounds of breathing and crying, then loud bangs, could be heard before the line went dead.JUST WATCHED Family killing suspect: Who is he? Replay More Videos ...

After the killings, he, his truck and the family dog went missing.Miller was later spotted by an ex-girlfriend in Petrolia, sparking the manhunt. He ditched his truck and authorities had thought he fled on foot into the mountainous forests of California's "Lost Coast."His remains were found about 1,500 feet from Miller's vehicle, the Sheriff's Office said. Near them, authorities recovered a handgun and loaded magazines.The ammunition in the magazines was consistent with ammunition found in Miller's truck, and at the family's slaying scene, the Sheriff's Office said.Last week, a 32-year-old suspected sex offender featured on the show died in a shootout in New York City as police closed in.Investigators said they sifted through hundreds of tips in their search for that suspect, Charles Mozdir, but a phone call they got during "The Hunt" helped them crack the case."It's been quite a week, and I think lots of people are relieved that both of these guys are off the streets," Walsh said Sunday.
