No comment," another family wrote.Any trails on social media?The newspaper reported that Wilson deactivated his social media accounts before his name went public.The only social media presence for him now is from supporters, who have set up Facebook pages to support and raise money for him.Posts express frustration about not being heard in the media and allege a lack of support for Wilson and law enforcement.Has he contacted his friends?One friend, Jake Shepard, told the Daily Mail newspaper in Britain that he'd texted with Wilson after a CNN appearance, and a woman going by the name "Josie" called a radio show to say she knew his side of the story.The Daily Mail reported that Shepard said he didn't know for sure where Wilson is but that he's safe and under 24-hour guard.Shepard said he received a text from Wilson after his CNN appearance, thanking him for the kind words he'd said, the newspaper reported.In his CNN interview, Shepard said he couldn't imagine the officer killing somebody."I can say -- without speaking to Darren, without even having heard his statements -- that, at that moment in time, he was scared for his life," Shepard said.JUST WATCHED Radio caller: Brown 'bum rushed' officer Replay More Videos ...
