At the time of the stunt, many New Yorkers wondered whether it represented an act of terrorism or an anti-American statement.But the artists, Matthias Wermke and Mischa Leinkauf, said the replacement of the American flags with two massive white flags last month was nothing more than an "art project" by the two performance artists meant to deal with "questions of historical legacy and art in the public sphere."The investigation into the incident is ongoing, and it's still unclear what, if any, charges the artists will face, according to the official.The artists dubbed the project "White American Flags," saying that "like an empty canvas, White American Flags invites many readings, multiple interpretations and projections."JUST WATCHED NYPD not surrendering on white flags Replay More Videos ...

The date turned out to be the 145th anniversary of Roebling's death.The Brooklyn Bridge opened in 1883 and at that time was the longest suspension bridge, according to the New York City Department of Transportation.
