This is when the bucket at the top of the ladder came close enough to power lines to shock the firefighters with electricity. There were two men inside the bucket and two on the ground.Captain Tony Grider, 41, and firefighter Simon Quinn, 22, were inside the bucket. They were taken to Taylor Regional Hospital and then transferred to the University of Louisville Medical Center Burn Unit."One is in critical condition, the other is fair.

Marrs was released and Johnson was admitted for observation, said Hazlette.The incident remains under investigation but according to Hazlette, the ladder never touched the nearby power lines."From talking with the power company, if you get within a distance of 3 to 4 feet, the energy that surrounds the high-voltage wire will actually arc over another object, in this case being the personnel occupying the bucket," said Hazlette.In a statement posted on their website Campbellsville University asked for prayers."We express heartfelt sympathy and prayers for the families of the two firefighters who were injured," said university President Michael Carter in the statement.The university's Baptist Campus Ministry held a prayer service on Thursday evening.The Ice Bucket Challenge is a social media campaign that aims to raise awareness and money to fight Lou Gehrig's disease, also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS.The ALS Association has received over $41.8 million in donations compared to $2.1 million during the same time last year.
