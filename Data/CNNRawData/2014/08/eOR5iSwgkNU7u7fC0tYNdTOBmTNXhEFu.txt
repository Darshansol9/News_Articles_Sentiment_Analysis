MUST WATCH Police: Robbery suspects holding hostages 01:08The four rescued hostages, including a 6-year-old child and a 12-year-old girl, were "traumatized" but unharmed, Dart said.Police knocked down a first-floor door and rushed up to the second floor, where they found the hostages and the suspects. Authorities decided to move after round-the-clock negotiations "were getting a little bit more on the dicier side," Dart said."It was the (proper) time to act," Dart said.Started with robbery attemptThe incident began at about 12:45 p.m. Tuesday when two people tried to rob the home, Dart said.Inside the home when the suspects arrived were four children from one immediate family, plus two children who are related to them, and the two women, Dart said.Police were called, and one responding officer was shot in the arm but is OK, Dart said. Another officer was injured and also is OK, Dart said, without elaborating.Sometime afterward, law officers from all over Illinois surrounded the residence and began the negotiating process.Four hostages -- children ranging in age from 1 to 12 -- were released Tuesday night and were not injured, police said.Dart said the talks persisted for hours and proved to be a "very thoughtful approach" to hostage negotiations. Then, the back-and-forth stalemated and "the time had come for certain action," Dart said."At this juncture it was the prudent thing to do, which was to enter the house and to secure the hostages to make sure they weren't being harmed," Dart said.Asked if police and the suspects were in a struggle, Dart answered: "They didn't surrender themselves."There's no indication that the suspects had any connection to the hostages before Tuesday, Dart said.Harvey Mayor Eric Kellogg had asked residents to stay inside their own homes as police, who blocked off nearby streets, dealt with the situation.A city of about 25,000 people, Harvey is about 20 miles south of Chicago.
