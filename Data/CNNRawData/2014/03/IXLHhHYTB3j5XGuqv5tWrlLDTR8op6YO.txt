"It may be a joke to them but to other viewers they can't help it, some will die because of obesity, no one should ever make fun of it."Shop owner Charley Dill, who's often been compared to the late roly poly actor Dom DeLuise and looks like he's had his hand in the candy jar a time or two, said it's just a fun way to celebrate Fat Tuesday."We are not trying to make a statement or do anything to offend anyone," he said. "We just thought it was a good way to invite people to come in and have a good laugh."While the offer may not appeal to everyone, Dill said "fellow fatties" from Columbia -- about 100 miles away -- have told him they're loading up the car and plan to flock to his shop.Dill even suggested future specials, like free candy for pregnant women on Labor Day.
