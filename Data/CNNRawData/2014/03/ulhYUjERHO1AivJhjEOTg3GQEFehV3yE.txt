Story highlights Online volunteers are viewing 2 million pages of satellite photos every 10 minutesThe crashed website is back running -- for nowCrowdsourcing search for Malaysian Airlines plane gets 100 million page views in 34 hours"There hasn't been the smoking gun ... that leads to the location" of plane, exec saysMore than 115,000 volunteers have joined the crowdsourcing search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane by going to their computers and reviewing satellite photos of the open ocean to find signs of the aircraft, a sponsor said Wednesday.In all, these humanitarian-minded volunteers have posted 100 million page views in the first 34 hours since the crowdsourcing campaign began this week. The public was viewing 2 million pages of satellite imagery every 10 minutes on Wednesday, said a senior director of a Longmont, Colorado, the firm that is leading the Internet effort.The volunteers are assisting the experts now in Malaysia and its surrounding ocean by looking for any sign of the commercial airliner.But as of Wednesday, the amateurs online hadn't had any luck."Up until now, there hasn't been the smoking gun, the final clue, that leads to the location of the wreckage of the missing aircraft," said Shay Har-Noy, founder of DigitalGlobe's tomnod.com , where the online searches are being conducted. It wasn't immediately clear whether authorities in Malaysia were aware of the crowdsourcing effort or chasing any leads identified by volunteers.JUST WATCHED Malaysian officials the 'worst I've seen' Replay More Videos ...

"The response has been extraordinary."In fact, scores of volunteers have posted their findings from tomnod.com on their CNN iReport pages, which is CNN's own version of crowdsourcing, sometimes used in the news outlet's coverage of world events.One CNN iReporter, Mike Seberger, early in the crowdsourcing campaign spotted an image in one satellite photograph that appears to be a commercial airliner floating in the ocean -- though Seberger concedes the silhouette also resembles a boat.His discovery, however, has apparently turned out to be a false alarm -- especially in the wake of Har-Noy's declaration Wednesday that none of the online tips has yet yielded a major clue.
