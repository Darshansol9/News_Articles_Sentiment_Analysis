You have to let me inâ€Ž,' " Marion said."I saw a young ... male in his 20s, no older than 30 -- blue oxford shirt with a black sling backpack -- get into a large racing-green landscaping truck. He backed it out of (the) visitors' space ... began ramming the building ... smashed through first section of atrium. ...The last thing I saw, the truck was fully in the lobby."Marion said he never saw the suspect get out of the truck. Police said the truck was stolen Tuesday from a State Highway Administration subcontractor.Trying to reportAll the while, WMAR journalists could relay information only via Twitter and the station's website.
