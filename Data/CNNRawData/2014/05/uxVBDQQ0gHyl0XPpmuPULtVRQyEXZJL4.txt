Sources now tell CNN the Office of Inspector General is investigating in six states, including Arizona."In response to allegations about scheduling and delays at the Phoenix VA," Shinseki will say according to the testimony, "I invited an independent investigation by the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) to conduct a comprehensive, thorough and timely review."If these allegations are true, they are completely unacceptable -- to veterans, to me and to our dedicated VHA employees," Shinseki says in the prepared testimony. "If they are substantiated by OIG, responsible and timely action will be taken."Shinseki also said that he has placed three employees, including two senior executives, on administrative leave at the request of the Inspector General's office.Shinseki will also tell lawmakers that he has directed the Veterans Health Administration to "complete a nationwide access review," according to the testimony.President Barack Obama has appointed Rob Nabors, his deputy chief of staff, to assist Veterans Affairs officials conduct the review."America has a sacred trust with the men and women who serve our country in uniform -- one that continues when they come home -- and we must do everything to keep that trust," Obama said in a statement Wednesday.The inspector general's investigation and access review, along with the administrative leave, have all been previously made public.
