Story highlights Star of "Snake Salvation" has died of venomous snakebitePentecostal Pastor Jamie Coots believes that God protects against venomous snakebitesCoots refused treatment for the bite, authorities saidA Kentucky pastor who starred in a reality show about snake-handling in church has died -- of a snakebite.Jamie Coots died Saturday evening after refusing to be treated, Middlesboro police said.On "Snake Salvation," the ardent Pentecostal believer said that he believed that a passage in the Bible suggests poisonous snakebites will not harm believers as long as they are anointed by God. The practice is illegal in most states, but still goes on, primarily in the rural South.Coots was a third-generation "serpent handler" and aspired to one day pass the practice and his church, Full Gospel Tabernacle in Jesus Name, on to his adult son, Little Cody.The National Geographic show featured Coots and cast handling all kinds of poisonous snakes -- copperheads, rattlers, cottonmouths. The channel's website shows a picture of Coots, goateed, wearing a fedora. "Even after losing half of his finger to a snake bite and seeing others die from bites during services," Coots "still believes he must take up serpents and follow the Holiness faith," the website says.JUST WATCHED Snake-handling pastor dies after bite Replay More Videos ...

We were honored to be allowed such unique access to Pastor Jamie and his congregation during the course of our show, and give context to his method of worship. Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time."In February 2013, Coots was given one year of probation for crossing into Tennessee with venomous snakes. He was previously arrested in 2008 for keeping 74 snakes in his home, according to National Geographic . Tennessee banned snake handling in 1947 after five people were bitten in churches over two years' time, the channel says on the show site.On one episode , Coots, who collected snakes, is shown trying to wrest a Western diamondback out of its nook under a rock deep in East Texas. He's wearing a cowboy hat and a T-shirt that says "The answer to Y2K - JESUS."The pastor is helped by his son and a couple of church members."He'll give up, just sooner or later," one of the members says. "Just be careful. Ease him out."The group bags two snakes, which a disappointed Coots says hardly justifies the trip to Texas."Catching two snakes the first day, 'course we'd hoped for more," Coots says in the video. "We knew that the next day we was gonna have to try to hunt harder and hope for more snakes."
