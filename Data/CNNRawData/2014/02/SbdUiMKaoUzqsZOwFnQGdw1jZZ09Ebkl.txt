So we get those speeds down it will be the difference between losing a life and saving a life," de Blasio said.The mayor's office released a statement Thursday in response to news reports about the mayor's speedy trip."We believe public safety is everyone's responsibility. We also recognize NYPD's training and protocols, and refer questions related to security and transportation to them. With that in mind, Mayor de Blasio is firmly committed to the traffic safety policies outlined this week," De Blasio press secretary Phil Walzak said in a statement.
