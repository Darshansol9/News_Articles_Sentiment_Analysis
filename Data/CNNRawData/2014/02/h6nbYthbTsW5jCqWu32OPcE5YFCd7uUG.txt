Lin arrived at the hospital within 10 minutes of the accident, and the baby was delivered in less than a minute, hospital spokeswoman Eileen Tynion said.Police said the Bobcat compact tractor equipped with a snowplow was backing up and struck the woman about 10:40 a.m. in a parking lot in the rear of Fei Long Market. Her husband was with her.The 42-year-old operator of the private snowplow was being questioned, police said.The incident occurred during New York City's sixth winter storm of the season. The latest storm was expected to dump up to 14 inches on some parts of the city.Fast-falling snow caused tractor-trailers to jacknife and prompted state authorities in New York to ban commercial traffic on Interstate 84, a major east-west highway.
