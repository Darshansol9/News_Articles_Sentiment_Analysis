Story highlights Federal prosecutors accuse a researcher of falsifying HIV researchThe NIH awarded Iowa State and the researcher nearly $15 millionWatchdog says Iowa State repaid the government about $500,000If found guilty, the researcher faces up to 20 years in prison and a $1 million fineAmes, Iowa (CNN) If government prosecutors are right, a former top researcher at Iowa State University is guilty of brazen scientific fraud-actions which a criminal complaint says have cost taxpayers nearly $15 million.Federal prosecutors accuse Korean-born researcher Dr. Dong Pyou-Han of deliberately falsifying key blood research into a possible vaccine for HIV.An indictment brought against Han says he falsely showed that rabbits infected with the virus had shown remarkable improvement.
