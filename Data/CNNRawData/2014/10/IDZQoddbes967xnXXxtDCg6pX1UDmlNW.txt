After Pham's treatment for Ebola and Bentley's quarantine, the two will be reunited Saturday.Pham was released from the National Institutes of Health in Maryland after undergoing treatment for the virus. She contracted it while caring for Thomas Eric Duncan, the first patient diagnosed in the United States. He died on October 8.Bentley captured hearts nationwide during news coverage of Pham, which included a picture of him nuzzling her in a car. The small spaniel is classified as a toy dog by the American Kennel Club, and is called a Blenheim Cavalier because of chestnut markings on a white coat."He's such a joy, you can't help but love this little guy," said Dr. Cate McManus, operations manager of Dallas Animal Services. " I can't wait to see him on talk shows when he's all healthy and out of here."But it's not been all stool and urine tests for the pooch.In addition to chasing after balls in his quarantine space, Bentley gets visits three times a day from caretakers in hazmat suits.
