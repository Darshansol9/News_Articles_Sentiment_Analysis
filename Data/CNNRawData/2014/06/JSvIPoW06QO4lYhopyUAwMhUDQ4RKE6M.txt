The $2 billion sale of the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers would allow for up to 10% of the price — or $200 million — to be spun off into a charitable foundation that Shelly Sterling would essentially run, a source familiar with the negotiations has told CNN.The source said Shelly Sterling and Ballmer would be co-chairs of the foundation, which would target underprivileged families, battered women, minorities and inner city youths.The source said Shelly Sterling's attorney, Pierce O'Donnell, suggested the idea to the NBA, which was receptive.Donald Sterling bought the team in 1981 for $12 million. His recorded racist remarks to his companion, V. Stiviano, spawned outrage among pro basketball fans, players and executives. The NBA banned him from the league and terminated his ownership rights in the franchise.
