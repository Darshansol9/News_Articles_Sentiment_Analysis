Hide Caption 14 of 14A man who said he was close friends with Meis' older brother and sister-and-law described him as "amazingly resourceful.""I wasn't surprised to see he was the hero -- his resourcefulness, love for others and knowledge of the greater good are what defines him, in my mind," Andrew Van Ness told CNN in an e-mail.Van Ness said Meis enjoyed playing a campus "humans versus zombies" game organized by the school's Student Union Board, finishing in the top 10 both times the game was held.On Thursday, Meis appeared shaken, at moments on the verge of tears, when ambulances arrived to tend to the wounded. Medics put him on a stretcher and took him to a hospital to check him over.Harborview Medical Center spokeswoman Susan Gregg didn't identify Meis by name but said a man believed to be the student hero was thoroughly evaluated and released. He had no injuries, she said.Police would not give out his name, but one of his friends was quick to point him out to CNN affiliate KOMO and pour out his gratitude."I could have been one of these people that was injured or in critical condition," said Meis' friend Patrick Maguire. "A lot of (students) were in that building, and he stopped him in the lobby. He didn't get any farther than that. I'm grateful for him, yeah."Meis, an engineering student, has a reputation for keeping a low profile, not seeking attention, The Seattle Times reported . He is known as a devout Christian and an excellent student.Meis' sister told the newspaper that the family wasn't commenting for the moment. But he hasn't been able to dodge the social media limelight, which has plastered his name and photos across the Internet with emphatic kudos.JUST WATCHED Gunman subdued by school monitor Replay More Videos ...

(Jn 15:13)," Tweeter Shane Bengry posted with reference to a Bible verseHis longtime roommate Ryan Salgado told The Seattle Times about the pepper spray.
