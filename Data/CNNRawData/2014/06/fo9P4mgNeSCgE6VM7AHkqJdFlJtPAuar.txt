I also disclaim any references in the form complaint of current head injuries," he said.The Sun Sentinel reported that Marino has said he only had two concussions in his 17 seasons.Marino was considered one of the most durable quarterbacks in the NFL and once started 99 games in a row. Known for a quick release and not getting sacked, he still holds several NFL records. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005.He did not return CNN's repeated calls for comment.NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said the league had no comment on the lawsuit.Other former players involved in the suit are Richard Bishop, Ethan Johnson, Chris Dugan, Anthony Grant, Mark Green, LaCurtis Jones, John Huddleston, Erik Affholter, Toddrick McIntosh, Dwight Wheeler, Jackie Wallace, Moses Moreno, Peter Manning and Bruce Clark.Had Marino remained a party to the suit, he would have been one of the most high-profile former players among thousands who are suing or have sued the league through many different legal filings. After his career, Marino worked as an NFL analyst for HBO and CBS.In the biggest concussion case, the NFL and at least 4,500 players proposed a $765 million settlement but a federal judge declined in January to approve the figure, saying she didn't think it was enough money.The estimated 20,000 class members over the settlement's 65-year lifespan would include former players with early dementia, moderate dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and/or death with a postmortem diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a brain disorder.Sports Illustrated reported that Marino would be eligible for benefits from that lawsuit.
