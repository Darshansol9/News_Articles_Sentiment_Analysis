Story highlights 11 homes have been evacuatedA wildfire last year may have played a role in the mudslideA California mudslide prompted the evacuation of 11 homes in Ventura County, about an hour north of Los Angeles.Heavy rain saturated the area Friday night about three hours before the mudslide occurred.One man was trapped inside a house that was surrounded by mud, but he was later found safe.Authorities said the evacuations of other homes was necessary."We are taking this precaution because it is dark and we cannot see the side of the mountain where the slide took place," Capt. Mike Lindbery of Ventura County Fire Department said early Saturday morning.There have been no reports of anyone else trapped.The area of the mudslide also suffered from a May 2013 wildfire that scorched 24,000 acres. The fire could have played a role in the blaze, since there was not enough vegetation to soak up the rainfall.
