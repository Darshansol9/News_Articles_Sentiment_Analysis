Story highlights House committee releases documents showing conversations about Phoenix VAA whistleblower reported at least 40 vets died waiting for careA new interim director was appointed for Phoenix VA facilityInterim director Glen Grippen is a 39-year VA employeeDespite congressional testimony to the contrary, documents released by the House Committee on Veterans Affairs show top officials with the Department of Veterans Affairs pushed the VA's watchdog to make changes to a major report about patient deaths at the Phoenix VA facility.At a sometimes tense congressional hearing September 17, the head of the VA's Office of Inspector General, Richard Griffin, rejected accusations that significant changes were made to the report, which outlined the results of a probe into patient deaths and scheduling issues.But a series of emails shows that then-acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson -- and other administration officials -- asked about and received changes to the report that Griffin did not mention in congressional testimony.Emails exchanged between Gibson and Griffin show that the two officials had private conversations about the report and related matters.In his testimony, Griffin stated, "In all instances, the OIG, not VA, dictated the findings and recommendations that appear in our final report," and he listed a switch in the order of some patient data, the semantics of a recommendation, a date and a couple of verb tenses as the only "minor" changes made after consulting the VA about the report.JUST WATCHED VA firing 4 senior officials over scandal Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH VA firing 4 senior officials over scandal 01:42But a series of email exchanges in July and August show the VA repeatedly communicated with the inspector general and pressed for certain language to be added to the report, including verbiage about allegations that 40 veterans died while waiting for care.An email dated July 28 shows the inspector general's office sent the draft report to Gibson, and on July 31 Deputy Inspector General John Daigh asked a VA administrator, "Was the message on the deaths well received by leadership?"On August 4, Gibson sent an email addressing the acting VA inspector general as "Griff" and asking why the allegation of 40 deaths was not included in the report."I was surprised to see no reference to the allegation of 40 deaths," Gibson wrote. "What was the conclusion and is there a reason this very serious allegation doesn't get directly addressed?"Griffin replied, "As I mentioned, the mysterious 40 deaths is being added to the draft."Griffin did not mention this addition when asked about changes to the report at the hearing before the House Committee on Veterans Affairs.The White House official directed to handle the VA scandal, Rob Nabors, also inquired about the 40 deaths, according to the email sent to the inspector general's office by a VA administrator.The emails also show that Sharon Helman, the director of the Phoenix VA -- who was placed on administrative leave for her alleged involvement in the scandal -- was not interviewed during the inspector general's investigation.When Gibson asked in his email why Helman had not been interviewed, Griffin responded, "... for a number of reason. Best to describe orally."The VA announced Tuesday that Glen Grippen had been appointed as the new interim director of the Phoenix VA. Grippen is a 39-year VA employee who retired from a regional director position.The Phoenix VA's main whistleblower, Dr. Sam Foote, originally alleged that 40 veterans died while waiting for care at the facility and that officials covered up the appointment delays to meet scheduling goals set by VA headquarters.After the inspector general's office released its report on the Phoenix VA in August, Foote called it a "whitewash" and said it downplayed how VA employee manipulations of patient appointments contributed to deaths. He also charged that the number of veterans who died while waiting was much higher than 40.In response to allegations of bias by the inspector general, Griffin previously said there is no basis in fact to support these claims."Our job is to speak the truth to power, and our record reflects that is exactly what we have always done," Griffin said in September.The inspector general's office said in a statement that the 40 deaths were included in the final report to answer anticipated questions since that number had been widely circulated in the media, a decision which was made "after ongoing internal deliberations."The inspector general's office added that Gibson asked questions about this number but did not directly request it be included in the report.Republican Rep. Jeff Miller of Florida, the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, is now calling for a new VA inspector general to be appointed to replace Griffin, who has been serving in an interim role since his predecessor retired in December 2013."In the midst of the largest and most damaging scandal in VA's history, it is vitally important that VA Office of Inspector General have an independent and objective leader in place to combat waste, fraud, and abuse," Miller wrote in a letter to President Barack Obama.Miller additionally critiqued the VA's inspector general for keeping private findings that revealed wait time issues at the Phoenix VA in 2008.The inspector general said in a statement that these 2008 scheduling issues were reported in a memo for the Phoenix VA's director and that related issues were addressed in a separate report publicly released about six years ago.
