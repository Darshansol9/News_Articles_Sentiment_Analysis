gun show loophole away called straw man provision banning sale distribution assault weapon thing well that gun safety part but let clear sad say anything happy country today many thousand people walking street speak suicidal homicidal either what people dominated nra saying oh mental health problem well truth but mental health problem it also gun issue deal well though 1993 vote brady bill would introduced lot gun control measure reform issue including background check waiting period well debate time it long long time ago understood case kind automatic background check opposed waiting time and people state preferred automatic background check rather waiting time think reason yes would say though tenure senator representative state thing influenced idea supporting universal background check supporting longer waiting period thing like regard gun reform well come state indicated gun control legislation and 30 year ago happens may lost election lost election three point running democrat republican opposed ban assault weapon supported ban that cost election mainly but 30 year ago not everybody talking point think voted way gave reason and also voted ban assault weapon think view many year bring people together example banning assault weapon real difference opinion country but many thing overwhelming support and right away seeing president one day say one thing another say something completely different but power nra bernie sandersdo think likely congress pas kind legislation soon obstacle think place prevent think 100 dependent upon grassroots activism so

grassroots activism think president trump courage take nra president trump lie time come idea may sound good in fact televised meeting member congress said thing wanted two day later backed away no
