word epidemic really justice scale human tragedy caused opioid drug use america else describe 145 largely avoidable death day opioids mostly prescribed painkiller obtained illicitly hooked previous treatment killed 53 000 people united state 2016 gun road accident that year saw death caused synthetic opioids mainly fentanyl double 20 145 commission set donald trump praised 56 relatively progressive recommendation issued october yet 90 day public health emergency declared trump run tuesday 23 january accused failing turn word fund action opioid drug important acute pain management following trauma surgery well end life setting their effect vary type individual taking extended period lead tolerance meaning larger dos needed along withdrawal symptom physical dependence addiction opioid painkiller related drug like heroin sedate user slow breathing at higher dos especially alcohol sleeping pill user fall asleep die automatic breathing mechanism shut concern increasing opioid abuse country far greatest death toll largely result pharmaceutical company aggressively marketing wide range condition including long term use mid 1990s millions american still hooked reversing tide likely beyond reach politician alone doctors drug company role play though recent research suggests scientist may hold key evidence emerging lab uk germany elsewhere suggests new generation safer painkilling opioids could soon available help end epidemic human body produce opioids compounds endorphin lock receptor embedded membrane cell brain spinal cord acting cellular gatekeeper help modulate thing like pain stress mood motivation hunger thirst synthetic opioids derived poppy work way modern research field origin 1970s scientist began isolate understand role opioid receptor subtypes called mu delta kappa well happens inside cell activated they belong larger group called protein coupled receptor gpcrs originally seen molecular switch flipped triggered cascade chemical change beginning molecule called protein binding inside receptor from 1980s scientist realised like switchboard 1970s 1990s prof robert lefkowitz duke university north carolina made series discovery gpcrs would eventually earn 2012 nobel prize chemistry he revealed example protein called arrestins previously seen dimmer switch acted inside cell turn effect protein also acted separate signalling pathway physiological effect late 1990s laura bohn working lab close prof lefkowitz duke genetically manipulating mouse longer produced protein called beta arrestin 2 when gave morphine knockout mouse improved painkilling power triggered fewer breathing problem they also suffered le constipation another side effect opioid drug prof bohn work helped open door new way making potentially safer opioid drug like traditional opioids target mu opioid receptor reduce pain protein signalling unlike however designed avoid attracting beta arrestin 2 receptor thereby avoiding risk user building tolerance taking potentially fatal overdoses 2007 several researcher worked lefkowitz set trevena biotech company based near philadelphia develop treatment based concept become known biased opioid last year trevena published partial result two phase three trial olinvo biased opioid designed use intravenous analgesic manage acute pain hospital setting low dose caused fewer breathing problem nausea vomiting morphine patient following bunion removal tummy tuck procedure however improvement good hoped higher dos greatest painkilling effect food drug administration fda due rule whether approve olinvo november hope olinvo help physician manage patient pain hospital potential better safety tolerability therefore play role solving pain management crisis say dr jonathan violin trevena co founder ethical approach opioid development today put addictive potential front centre worksome scientist wonder whether devastating side effect reduced even greater bias ratio favour protein signalling beta arrestin 2 pathway might super olinvo greater bias factor would work better olinvo say lefkowitz research published november bohn scripps research institute jupiter florida suggests may right her group identified existing favourably biased compound tweaked increase bias those larger bias produced fewer breathing problem bohn others seek targeted approach maximise opioid benefit minimise harm others gone way most drug market designed target one receptor actually interact others well although today painkiller largely target mu opioid receptor influence pain research suggests delta opioid receptor help mediate tolerance dependence prof andrew coop yorkshireman working university maryland school pharmacy baltimore city saw nearly 700 drug overdose death 2016 his search compound activate mu receptor blocking delta receptor began 1999 research published 2013 showed mouse given compound called umb425 achieved similar pain relief given morphine developed much le tolerance if result held true human could mean user le likely become dependent despite almost two decade search prof coop ready make compound available patient he conscious role previous generation scientist fuelling today opioid epidemic umb425 step forward halfway say designed prevent dependence stop rewarding effect associated abuse would inappropriate release drug working new version used get high coop alone belief incalculable damage caused previous scientific effort make safer opioids mean ethical approach today put addictive potential front centre work field prof stephen husband university bath began career working john lewis oversaw development buprenorphine opioid painkiller launched uk 1978 buprenorphine used treatment opioid addiction act mu opioid receptor activate fully
