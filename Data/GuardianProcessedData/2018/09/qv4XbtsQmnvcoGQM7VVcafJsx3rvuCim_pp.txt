every day city across country business open close move new location and every day city people move people move industrial neighborhood reinvented trendy hot spot populated new restaurant young professional search loft apartment formerly low income neighborhood modest bungalow gradually taken gentrifying upper income young family book site unseen uncovering hidden hazard american city sociologist scott frickel james elliott confront often overlooked environmental consequence change buried underneath america city hundred million pound hazardous waste deposited business size as frickel elliott write federal government estimate almost 800m pound hazardous waste released year figure excludes waste metal mining businesses big factory located well known industrial area attract attention activist neighbor government regulator others however small business modest enough activity may gone unnoticed neighbor regulator businesses may operation year closed identify site frickel elliott used historic state directory manufacturer construct historically hidden industrial database four river port city new orleans philadelphia portland minneapolis they examine interaction three distinct process industrial churning movement flow business around city residential churning movement people around city risk containment regulatory policy prioritize visible hazardous site clean mean distribution potential environment hazard urban landscape frickel elliott sat pacific standard answer question book shortcoming existing data source environmental hazard implication research city dweller united state collect data hazardous site example environmental protection agency toxics release inventory tri data set discus book what shortcoming existing data source respect identifying potentially hazardous site city sf database well known well understood limitation they start collecting data mid 1980s everything came simply make database these database also put pretty strict parameter around kind industrial site manufacturing process interested and scientific political reason parameter for example tri data manufacturer release le certain amount pollution annually exempted reporting release also hold true manufacturing facility employ relatively small number people je reporting also voluntary there various incentive reporting well ultimately facility report get around limitation used old manufacturing directory create new database hidden site four city what find site end locating time sf size matter thinking spatial geography manufacturing given city in every city looked area identified zoned heavy industry those industrially zoned area historically usually low laying land along riverbank along rail line recently along interstate highway exchange zoned industry long time and high density legacy site area these site usually think think heavy industry big factory one sort another visible landscape today may look like upscale loft apartment easily see exterior building used factory one sort another also found time gradual steady spread so site accumulate also spread one reason site industrialized past actually infrequently replaced industrial activity imagine parcel land old factory in ideal situation factory closed another factory would go right parcel land occupying building but found data commonly happens what commonly happens kind activity take place redevelopment involves something hazardous industrial activity smaller manufacturing facility many never recorded regulatory agency bound zoning rule corral large factory begin increasingly pepper landscape move around these smaller facility also turn faster rate larger facility go business frequently smaller easier redevelop thing kind disappear visible landscape quickly interesting somewhat surprising consequence change churn minority low income community exposed potentially hazardous site je run analysis likely exposed residential proximity also find thing come unfortunately expect vast research environmental injustice we find larger facility opening disproportionately concentrating area ethnic minority low income settlement begin consider spread accumulation across city land us change picture also change we begin see one colleague put together many different type neighborhood exposed also looked kind hazardous site attract attention regulator what characteristic site get cleaned je collected historical data thousand site matched data database local federal data site actually inspected case suspected contaminated yet inspected when match begin predict different quality facility gather epa attention attention local department environmental quality site risk containment process talk would predict large facility place decade it site people likely aware already problem facility operating large scale long time generating product waste high concern locally highlight different recommendation regulatory agency could implement better identify hidden danger can talk sf regulatory agency need create role people kind historical work done recover lost knowledge legacy site the data sitting historical manufacturing directory shelf state public library virtually every state country know agency actually historical site investigation general practice another general recommendation possibility sustainable city sustainable succession it critically important urban planner urban policy people talking green city sustainable city take history seriously for one main takeaway book city historical process pretend new technology new transportation infrastructure going make everything ok reckon long history chemical industrial production chemical use society much legacy buried around to pretend visible real mistake interview edited length clarity
