every human life alongside decision put men woman uniform harm way decision use force individual group even sworn enemy united state hardest thing president but decision must made given responsibility protect american people going forward asked administration review proposal extend oversight lethal action outside warzones go beyond reporting congress each option virtue theory pose difficulty practice for example establishment special court evaluate authorize lethal action benefit bringing third branch government process raise serious constitutional issue presidential judicial authority another idea suggested establishment independent oversight board executive branch avoids problem may introduce layer bureaucracy national security decision making without inspiring additional public
