enough detail nsa eavesdrops internet including today disclosure nsa deliberate weakening cryptographic system finally start figure protect past two week working guardian nsa story read hundred top secret nsa document provided whistleblower edward snowden part today story process well showed everything read confirms guardian reporting point feel provide advice keeping secure adversary primary way nsa eavesdrops internet communication network that capability best scale they invested enormous program automatically collect analyze network traffic anything requires attack individual endpoint computer significantly costly risky thing carefully sparingly leveraging secret agreement telecommunication company uk one many partner around world nsa get access communication trunk move internet traffic in case sort friendly access best surreptitiously monitor communication channel tapping undersea cable intercepting satellite communication enormous amount data nsa equivalently enormous capability quickly sift looking interesting traffic interesting defined many way source destination content individual involved this data funneled vast nsa system future analysis nsa collect much metadata internet traffic talking much mode communication metadata lot easier store analyze content it extremely personal individual enormously valuable intelligence system intelligence directorate charge data collection resource devotes staggering read status report status report program discussing capability operational detail planned upgrade each individual problem recovering electronic signal fiber keeping terabyte stream go filtering interesting stuff group dedicated solving its reach global nsa also attack network device directly router switch firewall etc most device surveillance capability already built trick surreptitiously turn this especially fruitful avenue attack router updated le frequently tend security software installed generally ignored vulnerability nsa also devotes considerable resource attacking endpoint computer this kind thing done tao tailored access operation group tao menu exploit serve computer whether running window mac linux io something else variety trick get computer your anti virus software detect trouble finding even knew look these hacker tool designed hacker essentially unlimited budget what took away reading snowden document nsa want computer period nsa deal encrypted data encounter subverting underlying cryptography leveraging secret mathematical breakthrough first lot bad cryptography if find internet connection protected chap example easy break recover key it exploit poorly chosen user password using dictionary attack hacker use unclassified world revealed today nsa also work security product vendor ensure commercial encryption product broken secret way know we know happened historically cryptoag lotus note public example evidence back door window people told recent story experience plan write soon basically nsa asks company subtly change product undetectable way making random number generator le random leaking key somehow adding common exponent public key exchange protocol if back door discovered explained away mistake and know nsa enjoyed enormous success program tao also hack computer recover long term key so running vpn us complex shared secret protect data nsa decides care might try steal secret this kind thing done high value target communicate securely adversary snowden said online soon made first document public encryption work properly implemented strong crypto system one thing rely believe true despite today revelation tantalizing hint groundbreaking cryptanalytic capability made james clapper director national intelligence another top secret document those capability involve deliberately weakening cryptography snowden follow sentence equally important unfortunately endpoint security terrifically weak nsa frequently find way around endpoint mean software using computer using local network using if nsa modify encryption algorithm drop trojan computer cryptography world matter if want remain secure nsa need best ensure encryption operate unimpeded mind five piece advice 1 hide network implement hidden service use tor anonymize yes nsa target tor user work the le obvious safer 2 encrypt communication use tl use ipsec again true nsa target encrypted connection may explicit exploit protocol much better protected communicate clear 3 assume computer compromised would take work risk part nsa probably if something really important use air gap since started working snowden document bought new computer never connected internet if want transfer file encrypt file secure computer walk internet computer using usb stick to decrypt something reverse process this might bulletproof pretty good 4 suspicious commercial encryption software especially large vendor my guess encryption product large company nsa friendly back door many foreign one probably well it prudent assume foreign product also foreign installed backdoor closed source software easier nsa backdoor open source software systems relying master secret vulnerable nsa either legal clandestine mean 5 try use public domain encryption compatible implementation for example harder nsa backdoor tl bitlocker vendor tl compatible every vendor tl bitlocker compatible giving nsa lot freedom make change and bitlocker proprietary far le likely change discovered prefer symmetric cryptography public key cryptography prefer conventional discrete log based system elliptic curve system latter constant nsa influence since started working snowden document using gpg silent circle tail otr truecrypt bleachbit thing going write there undocumented encryption feature password safe program command line using well understand impossible typical internet user even use tool everything working and still primarily window unfortunately linux would safer nsa turned fabric internet vast surveillance platform magical they limited economic reality rest best defense make surveillance expensive possible trust math encryption friend use well best ensure nothing compromise that remain secure even face
