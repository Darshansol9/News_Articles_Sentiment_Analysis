week we need start moving city soon storm passed and make sure yard flood river tunnel flood station flood etc look responsible fate it two year finishing planning phase still lot work but wait global strategy implemented interesting transit official wrote series suggest appearance coordination mta nyc hundred million dollar spent redundant project call redundant fifty year may able say global strategy overall city think mta smart always potential overlap sometimes fix thing waiting overlap materialize and think best course action agency like con edison transit department environmental protection go fixing hardening system global approach work necessary environmental funding process someone global perspective could say transit we going next year two next year two it take longer tell floodproofing project planning subway approach mta keep water first know possibly flood imposed flood mapping transit system identify vulnerable asset then figured best keep water destroying coming asset flood system asset thing like ventilation bay grating sidewalk people walk every day allows natural exchange air subway street those wind extreme vulnerability floodprone area there also manhole street equipment hatch sidewalk emergency exit underground evacuation none watertight developed structure vent bay example like bottomless box allows air day day allows release pin close bottom keeping water storm mta solution floodproofing manhole photograph metropolitan transportation authorityhow create solution keeping water did look city find innovative solution exploring used tokyo hong kong honestly one first thing storm worldwide survey transit system see brilliant idea existed thought and find innovative solution exploring used tokyo hong kong europe south america generally system prone flooding pretty much use technology proposing looked floodproofing technology available find existed kind facility transit so work vendor develop adapt technology system this really significant effort one example worked vendor develop flexible closure panel station staircase that let close staircase normally could allow water flood system deploying hi tech strong curtain material across horizontally facebook twitter pinterest sample flexible closure panel covering staircase whitehall st station money come pay project come federal transit authority we still design process couple year implementation go much money need still determined always going project get but believe transit vulnerable area made sustain similar event sandy the system remain vulnerable however put remedy place another storm like sandy happen tomorrow nothing changed yet pretty much still initial stage implementation we awarding slew project lower manhattan location next month construction next year end certainly expecting get work place another sandy type event but concern certainly expecting get work place another sandy type event but concern operating department plan temporarily protect vulnerable location another storm suddenly appear they barricade entrance like sandy build higher stronger one future certainly con edison hardening system and pumping capability water start come system gradual basis problem storm big sandy volume surge floating debris include massive object like dumpster when marine timber 30ft long traveling moving current water barrel wooden barricade trump temporary defense put during sandy even power there fighting chance working protect system storm like sandy bigger protecting storm degree stronger sandy two three time powerful city gon na trouble but storm grade fine spoke scientist klaus jacob suggested consider bigger longer term solution like raising entrance train raising train can imagine working something like actually to raise build new line never flood would significant investment and many year environmental funding process know ever money approach work absolutely is necessary not yet understand job anticipate thing may face 20 year right team need focus existing facility simply dollar rebuild system facebook twitter pinterest commuter pack train two day hurricane sandy limited public transit returned new york photograph allison
