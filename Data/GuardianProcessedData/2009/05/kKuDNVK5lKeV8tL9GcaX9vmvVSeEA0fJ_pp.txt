security interest permit our court allow and neither conscience last several week seen return politicisation issue characterised last several year understand problem arouse passion concern they we confronting complicated question democracy face but interest spending time relitigating policy last eight year want solve problem want solve together american ill served fearmongering emerges whenever discus issue listening recent debate heard word calculated scare people rather educate word politics protecting country so want take opportunity lay intend resolve outstanding issue explain action taking help build framework protects american people value hold dear and focus two broad area first issue relating guantánamo detention policy second issue relating security transparency let begin disposing one argument plainly going release anyone would endanger national security release detainee within united state endanger american people where demanded justice national security seek transfer detainee type facility hold manner dangerous violent criminal within border highly secure prison ensure public safety as make decision bear mind following fact nobody ever escaped one federal supermax prison hold hundred convicted terrorist as senator lindsey graham said idea find place securely house 250 plus detainee within united state rational currently process reviewing detainee case guantánamo determine appropriate policy dealing as acutely aware last administration detainee released return battlefield that away poorly planned haphazard approach let detainee go past instead treating case care attention law requires security demand going forward case fall five distinct category first feasible try violated american criminal law federal court court provided united state

war they allow protection sensitive source method intelligence gathering safety security participant presentation evidence gathered battlefield effectively presented federal court suggested represents reversal part they wrong in 2006 strongly oppose legislation proposed bush administration passed congress failed establish legitimate legal framework kind meaningful due process right accused could stand appeal however support use military commission try detainee provided several reform and reform making instead using flawed commission last seven year administration bringing commission line rule law the rule longer permit use evidence statement obtained using cruel inhuman degrading interrogation method we longer place burden prove hearsay unreliable opponent hearsay and give detainee greater latitude selecting counsel protection refuse testify these reform among others make military commission credible effective mean administering justice work congress legal authority across political
