washington it basically writes bill the civil right bill sent president eisenhower johnson rewrite bill it pass minimum wage disability housing johnson leaf from minute gone becomes mess today for half century mess the time senate worked like founding father intended work check government also creative force government six year majority leader it done it take type political legislative genius political genius caro concluded lay partly johnson ability take arcane rule make work build control loyalty but political brilliance miscalculated 1960 underestimating john kennedy hunger presidency

kennedy caro point kennedy cool handling cuban missile crisis evidence mastery foreign affair stand pressure hawk cabinet general johnson want attack cuba overrate greatness jack kennedy inspirational aspect foreign policy aspect presidency caro say however say domestic accomplishment would act become law not civil right voting right medicare medicaid education bill there real doubt mind whether

consensus politician get better highly partisan congress republican interested sinking presidency right country quite agree even one feel way say think real accomplishment one give credit caro talking healthcare landmark reform whose fate hand politicised politically divided supreme court balance power lean towards conservative think healthcare really think something lyndon johnson said passing first civil right bill 1957 civil right bill still senate he crude phrase break virginity easier next time then also said polished way pas easier go back fix keep thinking healthcare bill it done something it put 30 million people health insurance it prevented company denying people pre existing condition it done something it perfect bill but it easier go back fix congress stopped many thing achieved others it seems get nearly enough credit after obama lyndon johnson crack open senate another question caro face almost every public function sometimes circumspect sometimes direct but boil fact caro 76 take another decade write fifth final volume drama lbj presidency might never see it caro dy finished work abandoned no one else complete long done research last volume think short period
