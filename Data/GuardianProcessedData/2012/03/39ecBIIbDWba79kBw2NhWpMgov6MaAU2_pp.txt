inevitability american politics one increasingly relied upon quadrennial call non partisan third party presidential ticket put country ahead party end gridlock washington four year ago unity 08 failed get presidential ballot year version political pipe dream organization american elect publicly agitating presidential ticket answer directly voter political system somehow supposed stand contrast current nominating system appears rely pretty heavily voter previous third party movement like ross perot 1992 george wallace 1968 focused forcing idea political system neither two party clearly addressing indeed ron rapoport professor george mason university expert third party said third party successful degree identify constituency addressed two major party wallace message tailored blue collar southern voter anxiety racial integration larger concern economic social change perot say rapoport focused agenda reform balancing budget economic nationalism issue neither party directly tackling today third party movement geared particular policy even distinct segment population rather somewhat amorphous notion political system riven dysfunction saved non partisan political movement this argument predicated number assumption american politics false first idea exists wide cross section independent voter would embrace third party candidate in reality independent lean toward one political party number truly free agent member electorate le 10 considering level polarization two party number might even smaller cycle second assumption policy making washington somehow separated politics by conceit american elect public good take precedence else thwarted political party interested aggrandizement good america last assumption perhaps easily disprovable third party candidate could bridge gap republican democrat come policy solution supported significant number american take example recent word former oklahoma senator david boren strong public supporter american elect really seen inability either party reach across aisle used reach meeting mind the important ability next president must really bring two party together make two party system work way 20 25 year ago problem argument practically self evident even casual observer american politics consensus united state public good look like if anything quite opposite oddly ignored fact three year ago american people elected president precisely boren described it may seem like ancient history voter campaign trail 2008 obama regularly invoked notion post partisan washington president would look bigger government smaller government instead better government idea took campaign white house throughout first two year office obama consistently attempted reach across aisle reflect concern policy idea republican he stimulus bill healthcare reform much chagrin liberal supporter argued unpersuasively obama tried ram agenda congress regardless 2011 debt limit debacle offered republican grand bargain deficit reduction included small percentage tax increase much larger percentage cut medicare medicaid it deal weighted heavily toward conservative priority so effort work republican unequivocally rejected grand bargain refused negotiate healthcare reform reason stimulus financial regulatory reform passed white house able peel away handful gop senator get bill past threatened republican filibuster indeed last three year dominant stance republican congress reject overwhelming majority obama policy initiative since 2009 congress seen greater level procedural obstructionism ever american history come republican washington post columnist matt miller also third party bandwagon wrote last fall choose timid half measure anti tax fanaticism why president propose measure equal scale challenge might something fact one america two major political party made clear interested full measure half measure rather measure and view shared clear majority party member there reason believe republican would suddenly change political stripe policy view non partisan third party presidential election one certainly make argument obstructionism completely appropriate republican regularly using procedural weapon block legislation like healthcare reform fiscal stimulus argument interest greater good proposal would harm benefit indeed republican made clear believe federal government play minimal role possible life american people legislating woman body restricting marriage right excepted past year republican passed legislation would end federal guarantee medicare health insurance significantly cut funding education high speed rail environmental regulation enforcement would shred regulatory system general these policy almost uniformly opposed democratic politician standpoint area compromise two party issue how would third party non partisan president word american elect work together develop fresh solution serious challenge facing country they they would face challenge faced president obama growing large extent unbridgeable gap two party indeed perhaps oddest element american elect movement unlike previous election third party booster could argue clear choice voter tweedledum tweedledee difference two party year perhaps stark point recent american history bottom line like gridlock washington vote democrat if like gridlock vote republican if think government role responsibility ameliorate social economic inequality vote democrat if vote republican no one need third party candidate understand option
