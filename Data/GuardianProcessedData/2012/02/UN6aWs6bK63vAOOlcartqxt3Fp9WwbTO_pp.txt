momentum behind prospective israeli attack iran long concealed nuclear facility building every day brings new israeli warning situation intolerable attack iran nuclear site nothing done these warning met obfuscation bluster iran two state ratcheted shadow war assumed assassination around globe actual evidence behind iranian threat murkier many realize friday iaea report suggested many outstanding question iran uranium enrichment program intelligence agency remain unconvinced iran active program convert material bomb but much like iraq debate actual fact sidelined one wisdom striking first threat manifest israeli attack iran would neither clean effective proponent suggest and event unfold afterwards likely strategic disaster israel united state proponent israeli attack iran nuclear facility described surgical strike would destroy seriously damage iranian nuclear program without significant collateral damage the clear precedent strike would israeli airstrike osirak nuclear reactor iraq 1981 destroyed nuclear reactor set back iraq nuclear weapon program several year that attack conducted hour relatively small number plane cost 11 casualty crucially conducted without iraqi military response international outcry relatively muted similar successful strike apparent syrian nuclear facility 2007 appears created presumption among israeli leader surprise air strike stun disable target serious military response attempted assumption set stage debate israeli strike iran reason believe replay event likely instance in contrast small number involved osirak strike american defense official estimated israel would need use least 100 plane would fly relatively complicated route likely across iraqi airspace conduct attack iranian facility given iran capability prospect retaliation strike israel unlikely focus exclusively destroying dispersed often protected nuclear facility probably extend target list include radar air defense well much iran air force command control structure key facility elite military unit quds force israel also unlikely take unnecessary risk retaliation civilian may try destroy conventional missile capacity iran retains additional air strike covert operation extensive military operation involving dozen attack attempt destroy hostile neighbor air force sudden attack bear le resemblance osirak strike first operation six day war 1967 strategic consequence massive strike iran serious there real danger attack creates escalatory spiral conventional strike rapidly get hand assuming air strike destroy iran capacity launching missile tehran could launch limited conventional strike israeli city would put pressure netanyahu government respond kind escalate punish tehran if occurs one key assumption israel plan attack clean surgical kill large number civilian come doubt at least publicly israel estimated may absorb 500 casualty war defense minister ehud barak said 100 000 dead 10 000 dead 1 000 dead calculations based weak incompetent iranian response assume perhaps incorrectly israel current domestic preparedness mitigate effect iranian counterstrikes also estimate take account fact human cost war radically change calculation government if israel bear significant civilian casualty iranian counterstrike limit netanyahu government observe response how extent iranian casualty change calculus tehran if hundred thousand iranian left dead iran increasingly desperate government try draw israel messy war tit tat missile strike week rather day hope imposing political human cost israel give one alarming aspect current debate strike iran extent israeli leader appear discounted possibility according journalist david ignatius israel leader imagined operation probably short war scenario five day strike followed un sponsored cease fire but israeli leader made similar calculation attacked hezbollah force southern lebanon 2006 war dragged 33 day much higher israeli lebanese death toll originally envisioned pdf war rarely follow script timeline leader set it hard believe iran given week notice impending strike israel would play along script israeli leader laid similarly reason assume iran respond stunned way iraq syria israeli strike facility iran well publicized extensive nuclear program currently subject intense international scrutiny matter national pride different nature secretive singular program held iraq syria at time israeli attack neither iraq syria made nuclear program public centerpiece foreign policy iran done proven willing bear crippling sanction international condemnation sustain nuclear ambition while iraq syria willing take punch fire back hard imagine iran given much invested politically nuclear power iran government already paranoid facing widespread domestic discontent may also calculate could afford let affront stand without kind military response the domestic pressure respond furious population could even back tehran corner kind violent response necessary rather optional it also probably lost iranian leadership striking back israel political benefit producing rally around flag effect show defiance may even extend shelf life assuming iran incapable conventional response iran series option proxy respond israel hezbollah rocket attack israeli civilian target possible though guaranteed hezbollah may wary inviting israeli military response sake defending foreign patron hamas may also willing join fray launch rocket attack suicide bomber israel in addition israeli intelligence estimated iran many 40 sleeper cell around world could launch attack israeli target embassy guarantee attack limited region iran promised extend retaliation country might allow base used israeli strike iran could also decide activate dense network intelligence operative iraq afghanistan attack personnel facility country the iranian government also threatened close strait hormuz order drive world oil price even higher decision might precipitate confrontation naval vessel determined keep shipping lane open israeli official concluded nightmare scenario highly unlikely iranian promise retaliation bluff designed weaken support military israeli action they may right much may never come pas but miscalculation important israel wrong even one potential retaliatory option risk long messy conflict spread beyond border moreover happens day attack matter lot it hard imagine hezbollah attack israel would precipitate limited israeli military operation force lebanon iranian strike american embassy target abroad may push responding militarily iranian provocation former chief mossad meir dagan may wrong strike lead full fledged regional war lot terrible option short could come pas iran retains even one retaliatory option assuming israel launch attack also clear would effective stopping iranian nuclear program in osirak case record mixed air strike temporarily set back iraqi program bought time saddam hussein redoubled effort rebuild nuclear capability throughout late 1980s program discovered persian gulf war there evidence strike reinforced determination get bomb insurance policy future action israel later united state respect similarity iran today even favorable assessment israeli strike suggest best would set back iran program three five year moreover israeli military operation short outright regime overthrow likely entrench support nuclear program among iranian political leadership see race bomb way protect similar attack future in word israeli attack may temporarily set back program hasten iran nuclear ambition long term final piece strategic disaster israel strike would israel regional position an israeli strike iran may rupture israel shaky relationship egypt possibly jordan amid violent confrontation israel iran syria crisis may deepen assad regime may decide crush revolt rule world distracted crisis iran many emerging democracy middle east tunisia iraq even libya could find harder establish diplomatic tie israel widespread popular outrage attack an israeli strike iran may also stoke new fear region radically reorient alliance jeopardize fragile gain arab spring when dust settled attack israel may find even isolated weaker strategic position region today entire scenario present real strategic cost well if back israel participate directly operation also find increasingly isolated russia china european government move condemn attack accuse israel destabilizing middle east if crisis last longer day envisioned israeli official cause substantial civilian casualty either side ongoing political support israeli operation could lead kind rift europe seen since iraq war also distinct possibility spillover effect attack may make growing violence afghanistan worse iran decides escalate campaign subversion launch sponsor fresh attack soldier even silence israeli strike would interpreted green light much middle east would bear blame cost israel strategic miscalculation even never informed consulted beforehand given cost scenario laid clear need tell israel allow diplomatic pressure economic sanction iran run course many american politician fond saying firm friend israel strongly support security but case friend israel mean marching lockstep towards strategic disaster true friend israel speaks truth matter unpleasant order stop talking false choice making grave mistake
