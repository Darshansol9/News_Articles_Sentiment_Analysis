(CNN) An Ohio detective has died three days after being shot twice in the face while serving a drug-related search warrant, police said.

Jorge DelRio, a 30-year veteran of the Dayton Police Department, was shot Monday evening as he went down to the basement of a residence that was being searched by agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration.

He donated organs before he died, department officials said on Twitter.

"We have not even begun to adjust to a professional or personal life, that does not include George's presence," Dayton Police Chief Richard Biehl said during a short media briefing Thursday.

We are heartbroken to announce the passing of Det. Jorge Del Rio who succumbed to a line of duty injury today November 7, 2019. Earlier today at Grandview Hospital, Det. Del Rio acted to save lives through the generous gift of organ donation.
